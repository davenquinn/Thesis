\chapter{Introduction}

Reading environmental markers from the geologic record is key to
understanding the evolution of the Earth through time. Packages of rock
provide a window into the systems and processes that operated throughout
the past. Their properties capture information about their formation
environment, and these vignettes can be used to test the applicability
of mechanistic and theoretical frameworks for global change. Th

There are two major aspects of this approach that must be unified.
First, detailed observations of key features of the geologic system must
be isolated and probed with the appropriate techniques for developing a
detailed understanding of individual components. Second,
observations must be contextualized with their surroundings,
allowing disparate environmental markers to be integrated into a
sequence that can illuminate global change.

# Bridging scales of planetary observation

On Earth, operating over a range of scales has been fundamental
to geology since its inception as a branch of science. Since their
earliest scientific inspection, rocks have been investigated
based on microscopic features, such as their fossil content,
at human scale, using their outcrop geology and local structural
geometry, and at regional scale with structural mapping and correlation.
Global summary of regionally-observed trends has enabled
the systematization of Earth history and understanding of its
surface environment through time.

The methodology employed in small-scale studies has changed fundamentally over
time, with the development of imaging and geochemical techniques that
increase the amount of information that can be gleaned from a single
sample. The techniques employed in global studies have dramatically
shifted as well, with satellite imaging and modeling approaches
fundamentally altering how problems are investigated, providing
more powerful types of information that cannot be gained in other ways.

Our understanding of regional-scale geologic
problems on Earth has been limited primarily by the ability to
synthesize abundant data. Thus, regional geologic systems are
still fundamentally characterized with geological mapping:
technical development has served mostly to
increase its efficiency and encourage revision based on new new
interpretive frameworks [e.g @Atwater1970; @Liu2010].

For structural mapping studies, technology-driven measurements
in adjacent fields such as geochemistry have motivated increased specificity
of mapping problems, rather than replacing them [e.g. @Wernicke2011;
@Flowers2012; @Lucchitta2013]. The scale mismatch of localized
geochemical data with regional and global interpretive frameworks
means that detailed regional mapping studies retain their importance.

New branches of science that have been enabled by technical advances
often find it hard to replicate this middle-level component. For
instance, global averaging by geochemical proxies is extremely powerful
for understanding the large-scale evolution of the Earth, its
continents, and its surface biogeochemical systems [e.g. @DePaolo1976b;
@Paytan2004; @Rohrback2007; @Workman2005; @Halverson2010], and
small-scale systems have been increasingly well understood [e.g. @Gansecki1998;
@Bindeman2008], but regional contextualization
necessarily relies on inference to from relatively limited sample sets
[e.g. @Luffi2009].

A similar dynamic is present in Mars science: generalized study of the
planet's surface is enabled by remote-sensing data [e.g. @Malin2000;
@Ehlmann2009; @Lefevre2009] and modeling [e.g. @Wordsworth2015; @Soucek2015], and
localized elements can be studied by rovers [e.g. @Arvidson2014]
or Mars meteorites, as
permitted by sampling [e.g. @Rankenburg2006; @Agee2014]. Cases where
abundant data is available, such as landed rover campaigns, have made
the most progress in understanding the evolution of integrated geologic
systems [e.g. @Grotzinger2015], but even here there is a major scale
gap, both in the lack of intermediate-scale data [@Stack2015] and in
interpretive space -- at Gale Crater, inferring planetary evolution is
difficult due to the lack of time constraints and an understanding of
regional differences.

# Differently scaled explorations of continental margins

This dissertation consists of several projects that explore different
parts of this conceptual space, and try to bridge the scale gap
through the application of new methodologies. Within this overarching framework,
the investigations here are aligned by their examination of the
structure of continental margins.

On both Earth and Mars, continental edges are
expressed as regions of high topographic gradients separating areas of
fundamentally different crustal structure. On Earth, where continents are
formed by tectonic processes, continental edges are the locus of this
construction, and we seek to understand the process of this construction
in Chapter 2, an investigation of xenoliths from coastal California.
This study uses investigation of single samples in conjunction with a
broad contextual review and modeling approach to estimate the structure
and origin of a mantle domain beneath the Coast Ranges. This approach
illustrates the level of work required to link between two disparate
scales.

The topographic gradients of continental margins on both Earth and Mars
provides a setting for the formation and preservation of stratigraphies that
record key sequences in planetary evolution. The remaining chapters use
structural techniques to understand stratigraphies that are relatively
unstudied due to poor data availability (on Mars) and structural
complexity (on Earth).

In Chapters 3 and 4, we apply mapping techniques to NE Syrtis,
a stratigraphy of global importance on Mars, which has gone unstudied
due to the difficulty of making detailed structural inferences from
orbital data. Chapter 3 lays out new structural methods constructed
for this effort, and Chapter 4 applies it to construct a detailed
and interpretive regional structural map of NE Syrtis.

In Chapter 5, we apply structural mapping techniques
to the Naukluft Nappe Complex in Namibia, which has been treated
imperfectly by several generations of workers. Our study is a
straightforward use of mapping and stratigraphy, eased by the
introduction of new technology into the mapping process.

\chapter{Introduction}

Reading environmental markers from the geologic record is key to
understanding the evolution of the Earth through time. Packages of rock
provide a window into the systems and processes that operated throughout
the past. Their properties capture information about their formation
environment, and these vignettes can be used to test the applicability
of mechanistic and theoretical frameworks for global change.

There are two major aspects of this approach that must be unified.
First, detailed observations of key features of the geologic system must
be isolated and probed with the appropriate techniques for developing a
detailed understanding of individual components. Second,
observations must be contextualized with their surroundings,
allowing disparate environmental markers to be integrated into a
sequence that can illuminate global change.

# Bridging scales of planetary observation

On Earth, operating over a range of scales has been fundamental
to geology since its inception as a branch of science. Since their
earliest scientific inspection, rocks have been investigated
based on microscopic features, such as their fossil content,
at human scale, using their outcrop geology and local structural
geometry, and at regional scale with structural mapping and correlation.
Global summary of regionally-observed trends has enabled
the systematization of Earth history and understanding of its
surface environment through time.

The methodology employed in small-scale studies has changed fundamentally over
time, with the development of imaging and geochemical techniques that
increase the amount of information that can be gleaned from a single
sample. The techniques employed in global studies have dramatically
shifted as well, with satellite imaging and modeling approaches
fundamentally altering how problems are investigated, providing
more powerful types of information that cannot be gained in other ways.

Our understanding of regional-scale geologic
problems on Earth has been limited primarily by the ability to
synthesize abundant data. Thus, regional geologic systems are
still fundamentally characterized with geological mapping:
technical development has served mostly to
increase its efficiency and encourage revision based on new new
interpretive frameworks [e.g @Atwater1970; @Liu2010].

Technology-driven measurements
in adjacent fields have motivated increasingly targeted
assessment of regional structural relationships, rather than replacing
the technique of regional mapping. A key case is the recent debate over the age of the Grand Canyon,
which grapples with the reconciliation of geochemical ages constraining canyon incision
with geologic cross-cutting relationships [e.g. @Wernicke2011;
@Flowers2012; @Lucchitta2013]. The scale mismatch of localized
geochemical data with regional and global interpretive frameworks
means that detailed regional mapping studies retain their importance.

New branches of science that have been enabled by technical advances
often find it hard to replicate this intermediate-scale component. For
instance, global averaging by geochemical proxies is extremely powerful
for understanding the large-scale evolution of the Earth, its
composition, and its surface biogeochemical systems [e.g. @DePaolo1976b;
@Paytan2004; @Rohrbach2007; @Workman2005; @Halverson2010], and
small-scale geochemical systems have become increasingly well understood [e.g. @Gansecki1998;
@Bindeman2008], but regional contextualization of these results
necessarily relies on inference from relatively limited sample sets
[e.g. @Luffi2009] or, where possible, regional mapping studies [e.g. @Saylor1996; @Dibenedetto2005].

A similar dynamic is present in Mars science: generalized study of the
planet's surface is enabled by remote-sensing data [e.g. @Malin2000; @Murchie2007; @McEwen2010],
and modeling can drive understanding of the global environment through time
[e.g. @Wordsworth2015; @Soucek2015]. Meanwhile,
localized systems can be studied using rovers [e.g. @Squyres2005; @Grotzinger2012]
or Mars meteorites, as
permitted by sampling [e.g. @Rankenburg2006; @Agee2014]. Cases where
abundant data is available, such as landed rover campaigns, have made
the most progress in understanding the evolution of integrated geologic
systems [e.g. @Grotzinger2005Burns; @Arvidson2014; @Grotzinger2015], but there remains a major scale
gap, both in the lack of data at scales intermediate between orbital and rover imagery [@Stack2015] and in
interpretive space --- inferring planetary evolution from
rover campaigns is difficult due to the lack of time constraints
on geologic snapshots characterized during landed missions. Attempts to bridge this conceptual divide
necessarily involve modeling [@Tosca2006; @Andrews-Hanna2007] or detailed geologic mapping [@Lichtenberg2010].

# Differently scaled explorations of continental margins

This thesis consists of several projects that explore different
parts of this conceptual space and try to bridge the scale gap
through the application of new methodologies. Within this overarching framework,
the investigations here are aligned by their examination of the
structure of continental margins.
On both Earth and Mars, continental edges are
expressed as regions of high topographic gradients separating areas of
fundamentally different crustal composition and structure.
The topographic gradients of continental margins on both Earth and Mars
provide a setting for the formation and preservation of stratigraphies that
record the surface environment at key time periods in planetary evolution.

On Earth, continents are formed by tectonic processes, and continental
edges are the locus of this construction. Chapter 2 of this thesis
describes the process of construction of the continental margin
terrane of coastal central California.
This study uses investigation of mantle-sourced xenolith samples
to estimate the structure
and origin of a mantle domain beneath the Coast Ranges, linking
the two scales using both a review of geologic context and modeling.

The latest Neoproterozoic Eon and its boundary with the Cambrian Period is
a time of rapid global change culminating in origin of animal life
[@Hoffman1998; @Knoll1999]. Stratigraphies covering this period can yield
information on the regional environment during this period of global change. In
Chapter 3, we apply structural mapping techniques to the Naukluft Nappe Complex
in Namibia, which dates from this time period but is tectonically displaced and
deformed. We present the first detailed description of a thick, continuous
passive-margin stratigraphy that records the Neoproterozoic paleoenvironment at
the margin of the Kalahari Craton. This study is a straightforward application
of geologic mapping and stratigraphy, eased by the introduction of new
technology into the mapping process.

The remainder of this thesis deals with the structural assessment of
paleoenvironmentally important stratigraphies on Mars. Reconstruction of
depositional environments from Martian sedimentary rocks is limited by the
accuracy of bedding orientation measurements. Chapter 4 explores the difficulty
of making structural measurements from orbital data, and proposes general
statistical and visualization tools to improve error reporting and data quality
for remotely-sensed bedding orientations. Chapter 5 applies this method, along
with regional mapping, to northeast Syrtis Major, a stratigraphy dating from
early in Mars' history, in order to infer the surface environmental progression
within the region. We find evidence for episodes of regional inundation and
erosion spanning much of Mars history, from the Noachian to Early Amazonian.

\chapter{Conclusion}

Continental margins on Earth are the locations where the continents are added
to by both sedimentary and tectonic accretion, forming first-order features
such as the Earth's freeboard [@Wise1974], which sets the basic conditions for
much of the Earth surface system, such as its climate, sedimentation patters,
and modes of biogeochemical cycling [e.g. @Hyde2000]. Understanding the
fundamental architecture of these systems provides information into the Earth
and Mars system.

In Chapter 2, we outline an example of how a substantial fragment
of the lithospheric underpinnings of the continental margin (the entire
substrate of the Mojave Desert block in California) was replaced by new
lithospheric material. The emplacement of a large mass of lithospheric mantle
of oceanic origin beneath the crust suggests an isostatic reason that the
Mojave block remained near sea level for much of Cenozoic time.
This mantle lithosphere seems to have shielded the base of the crust from
the major effects of the Neogene slab window.

Whether continental crust was fundamentally created through time or generated
early in Earth history is debated in the literature [@Wise1974; @Schubert1985;
@Hynes2001]. It is unclear what effects this accretion had on the volume of
North America --- this tectonic addition could have been balanced by erosion as
is well-documented in the Late Cretaceous by @Kidder2006, @Chapman2012, and
others in specific locales of the southern Sierra Nevada and Coast Ranges.
However, this mode of addition at the base a continent has not been so well
documented before.

In Chapters 3 and 4, we apply structural mapping techniques to a stratigraphy on Mars.
Chapter 3 represents our most significant attempt to improve the toolset available for
structural mapping with remote-sensing data, and we create a method that allows significant improvement in the
amount of bedding-orientation information that can be extracted given a remotely-sensed dataset.
This slightly improves options for working in spite of the scale gap between orbital
and landed data that is inherent to Mars geology.

In Chapter 4, we apply the methodology constructed in Chapter 3 to a globally significant stratigraphy
at NE Syrtis Major,
discovering that it records a varied and multistage history of sedimentary deposition
from the Noachian into the Amazonian. The basic sedimentary substrate of the
sequence mapped and described in this chapter was likely formed by deep basinal deposition at the
margin of Isidis Basin; the architecture of a bounding basin required to contain such deposition
is unclear, but may either be unconfined (i.e. an ocean) or confined by a previously-existing ice
sheet in Isidis Basin [@Soucek2015]. We construct a geologic map based on a much more
thorough characterization of units and their geologic meaning than current morphologic mapping
studies [@Bramble2017].

Linking our examinations of the geologic history to that of the deep lithosphere of Earth,
we observe that on Mars, the structure of the deep crust and  the processes by which it
was formed remain fundamentally unknown. Was it created during planetary formation and
subsequent bombardment during solar system formation and mostly altered in place?
Or was there an early intense epoch of resurfacing or "gardening" of the
planet at the free surface? Extensive lava
flows have been documented to cover much of the planet [e.g. @McEwen1999]
and fill the northern plains of the planet to significant depth [@Pan2017].
Extensive, middle-crustal mafic layers have been documented to be laterally
regionally continuous [@Edwards2008], suggesting formation at the surface.
Future work with exposures of the middle crust from orbit can use structural tools
to evaluate layering styles in the Martian basement, to try to build a 3D structural picture of Mars.

In Chapter 5, we document the re-mapping of the Zebra Nappe of the Naukluft Nappe Complex. We substantially
simplify the tectonic dynamics and stratigraphic architecture envisioned by previous workers [@KornMartin1959; @Hartnady1980].
This project is a clear example of the augmented power of modern mapping studies supported by technologies
such as satellite and UAV imagery, digital methods of data display, and modern tectonostratigraphic
interpretive frameworks. The success of this project provides a clear endorsement of the continued relevance
of mapping-based geologic studies and the desirability of replicating techniques for extracting regional meaning from datasets in contexts with less ideal data availability.

Continental-margin sedimentation

Why were the fragments at Syrtis preserved?

Mantle (and crustal-root) effects on sedimentation 

Underplating of oceanic crust in the Cretaceous, and Neogene delamination of an arc crustal root, has played a huge role in the crustal structure of the Cordillera.

Within the western Cordillera, we have documented better than almost any place on Earth that underplating and delamination are responsible for major topographic gradients.

Isostatic effects proved important in where basins developed, vs. mountain ranges.

This can be extended to Mars. Now that we have discovered large sedimentary deposits at the edge of basins (in some cases perched at high elevations such as on the margin of the Valles Marineris system), we can try to use them to infer sedimentary history. To what extent do modern elevations and long-wavelength topographic relationships retain fidelity from Noachian Mars? When did the “Tharsis bulge” develop?

This is of crucial importance to basin analysis going forward, and understanding of the possible extent of a potential ocean

Understanding the structure of the
continental margins and the sediments that overtop them, as well as the
potential interplay between tectonic and sedimentary processes, is a crucial
aspect of understanding a planetary system.

## Regional-scale geologic mapping


## Extending approaches to regional geologic studies

There is a long and rich history of regional geological studies on Earth,
starting from the first conceptions of Earth history by mapping of
successive stratigraphic sequences. Geological studies are
tied to geologic maps as a fundamental mode of display. Geologic maps serve
as a medium to both display basic data (the location and stacking patterns of
rock units) and to convey interpretations and synthesis of this data. Truly
integrated geological mapping studies draw on localized information from
a wide spectrum of geological methods that can provide info on the regional
setting, and reflect a high-level interpretation and synthesis of this work.

As the future of Mars exploration moves from a crater-interior
[@Grotzinger2013; @Grotzinger2015] to a
basin-margin depositional setting, the

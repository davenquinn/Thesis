\chapter{Conclusion}

Continental margins on Earth are the locations where the continents are added
to by both sedimentary and tectonic accretion, forming first-order features
such as the Earth's freeboard [@Wise1974], which sets the basic conditions for
much of the Earth surface system, such as its climate, sedimentation patters,
and modes of biogeochemical cycling [e.g. @Hyde2000]. Understanding the
fundamental architecture of these systems provides information into the Earth
and Mars system.

In Chapter 2, we outline an example of how a substantial fragment
of the lithospheric underpinnings of the continental margin (the entire
substrate of the Mojave Desert block in California) was replaced by new
lithospheric material. The emplacement of a large mass of lithospheric mantle
of oceanic origin beneath the crust suggests an isostatic reason that the
Mojave block remained near sea level for much of Cenozoic time.
This mantle lithosphere seems to have shielded the base of the crust from
the major effects of the Neogene slab window.

Whether continental crust was fundamentally created through time or generated
early in Earth history is debated in the literature [@Wise1974; @Schubert1985;
@Hynes2001]. It is unclear what effects this accretion had on the volume of
North America --- this tectonic addition could have been balanced by erosion as
is well-documented in the Late Cretaceous by @Kidder2006, @Chapman2012, and
others in specific locales of the southern Sierra Nevada and Coast Ranges.
However, this mode of addition at the base a continent has not been so well
documented before.

In Chapter 3, we document the re-mapping of the Zebra Nappe of the Naukluft
Nappe Complex (NNC). We substantially simplify the tectonic dynamics and
stratigraphic architecture envisioned by previous workers [@KornMartin1959;
@Hartnady1980]. This project is a clear example of the augmented power of
modern mapping studies supported by technologies such as satellite and UAV
imagery, digital methods of data display, and modern tectonostratigraphic
interpretive frameworks. The success of this project provides a clear
endorsement of the continued relevance of mapping-based geologic studies and
the desirability of replicating techniques for extracting regional meaning from
datasets in contexts with less ideal data availability.

In Chapters 4 and 5, we apply structural mapping techniques to a stratigraphy
on Mars. Chapter 4 improves the
toolset available for structural mapping with remote-sensing data: we
create a statistical method that allows significant improvement in the amount of
bedding-orientation information that can be extracted from a remotely-sensed
dataset. This method is coupled with new visualization approaches and software
pipelines that provide new ways to work with structural data collected remotely.
This method is valuable for planetary science, but also in terrestrial studies
using unmanned aerial vehicles and structure-from-motion techniques.

In Chapter 5, we apply the methodology constructed in Chapter 4 to map and
describe a globally significant stratigraphy at northeast Syrtis Major. We discover
that the sequence records a varied and multistage history of sedimentary
deposition from the Noachian into the Amazonian. The layered sulfates that
anchor this sequence were likely formed by deep basinal deposition at the
margin of Isidis Basin. The architecture of a bounding basin required to
contain such deposition is unclear, but may either be unconfined (i.e. an
ocean) or confined by a previously-existing ice sheet in Isidis Basin
[@Soucek2015]. We construct a geologic map based on a much more thorough
characterization of units and their geologic meaning than current morphologic
mapping studies [@Bramble2017].

This dissertation has demonstrated the application of structural geologic methods
to regional systems on Earth, in one case using stratigraphy and
structural mapping, and in another using geochemistry and modeling. Additionally,
we cover the extension of these methods to Mars science, building tools and
describing the environmental signals contained in a key stratigraphy.
These studies illuminate several directions of future study in Earth and Mars science.

Our terrestrial study of the deep lithosphere in Chapter 2 was enabled by
geologic mapping of crustal-level exposures throughout California, seismic
data, tectonic reconstructions, and geophysical modeling. This integrated
approach led to a to a new conceptual framework for understanding the "slab
window" beneath the California coast and Mojave Plateau. How does this new
understanding  relate to the geology and petrology of Miocene volcanism in the
region? Testing against this refined framework will improve our process-based
understanding of the formation and tectonic modification of the coast of North
America.

Chapter 2 also suggests new avenues for Mars science.
On Mars, the structure of the deep lithosphere and the processes by which it
formed remain fundamentally unknown. Was the lithosphere created during planetary formation
and mostly altered in place? Or was there an early epoch of resurfacing of the
planet? Extensive lava flows have been documented to cover
much of the planet [e.g. @McEwen1999] and to fill the northern plains of the
planet to significant depth [@Pan2017]. Regionally extensive, laterally continuous
middle-crustal mafic layers suggest formation at the surface [@Edwards2008]. Still, studies of surface--interior
coupling are based on poorly constrained compositional models [e.g. @Wade2017].
New geophysical data \[e.g. from the InSIGHT mission, @Banerdt2013\] will substantially
improve this situation, and mapping middle crustal exposures from orbit using
structural tools developed in this dissertation can build complementary constraints.
These new tools will ultimately lead to a new understanding of the deep structure of Mars.

In Chapter 3, our study of the Zebra Nappe of the NNC is the first detailed
description of a thick passive-margin stratigraphy on the Kalahari Craton. This
sedimentary sequence contains environmental proxies relevant to Neoproterozoic
Earth history and builds out a tectonic sequence of events that can be used to
test the history of the Damara orogen and Pan-African assembly of Gondwana
[e.g. @Gray2008]. There are several more nappe units in the NNC, and future
study will continue to place nappe segments in age context, building a new
record of Neoproterozoic Earth history that can be compared to existing
systems. Late-Neoproterozoic Earth is understood from relatively few stratigraphies,
and new proxies from the NNC will provide data to assess regional variability
and potential drivers for the evolution of animal life on Earth.

Where the NNC represents a set of fragmentary windows in the Neoproterozoic
stratigraphy and the paleoenvironment of Earth during the Cryogenian --
Ediacaran periods, Northeast Syrtis Major on Mars represents an in-place,
relatively complete record of early Mars history, analogous to Neoproterozoic
reference sections in northern Namibia [@Hoffmann1996; @Hoffman1998] and Death
Valley, California [e.g. @Corsetti2005a; @Petterson2011]. We hope that Chapter
5 of this dissertation will serve as a similar guide to the history of the Mars
surface environment over a period of global change. However, many
more fragmentary records of Mars surface geological history exist. These
sometimes capture higher levels of detail than the Syrtis Major stratigraphy, as
with delta deposits and their context at Aeolis Dorsa [@DiBiase2013;
@Kite2015]. Other areas capture regionally-differentiated systems, such as at
Uzboi Vallis [@Grant2011] or Gale Crater [e.g. @Milliken2010]. Further
understanding of Mars history can put the environments captured by of these
regions in the context of the Noachian--Amazonian history recorded at Northeast
Syrtis. As in Earth science, such an approach allows the best chance of capturing
regional variation and a detailed, time-ordered history of the Mars environment.

The methods developed in Chapter 4 were created to enable Chapter 5 but are broadly
applicable to terrestrial and planetary geoscience, and potentially to surface-fitting and remote-sensing
applications in other domains. The developed method relies on both detailed statistics
and new visualization approaches, and its supporting software provides a user interface to easily
interact with the statistical tools. Such integrated approaches with
custom data pipelines and user interfaces are becoming increasingly valuable for the capture
and distillation of complex data in the geosciences. So too are rigorous standards for data
archival and reporting. Moving forward, similarly deep analyses of the structure of data will be crucial for
methods development across the geosciences.

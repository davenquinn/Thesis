\chapter*{Abstract}

This dissertation explores the structural context around several
key environmental transitions on Earth and Mars which are expressed at continental margins.
Regional mapping
techniques are applied to build links between methodologies used to explore
rock samples and units --- stratigraphy, structural geology, remote sensing, geochemistry,
petrology, and geodynamic modeling.
Four research projects are presented: Chapter 2 explores the tectonic context of xenoliths
beneath the western margin of North America and illuminates the structural history of the
lithospheric underpinnings of the California coast. Chapter 3 builds a new method for applying
statistical error bars to remotely measured planar orientations, and Chapter 5 applies this
method to mapping the 3D structure of a globally significant stratigraphy on Mars.
We find a long history of interaction with water at the margin of Isidis Basin.
Finally, we undertake a structural study of the southern Naukluft mountains, and re-interpret
its structural history and age from previous work. Together, these efforts demonstrate the application of structural techniques in several domains, and the creation of new techniques to support
geological analysis in contexts where data is more poorly resolved.

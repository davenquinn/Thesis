\chapter*{Abstract}

This dissertation explores the structural context around several key
environmental transitions on Earth and Mars which are expressed at continental
margins. Regional mapping techniques are applied to build links between
methodologies used to explore rock samples and units --- stratigraphy,
structural geology, remote sensing, geochemistry, petrology, and geodynamic
modeling. Four research projects are presented: Chapter 2 explores the tectonic
context of xenoliths beneath the western margin of North America and
illuminates the structural history of the lithospheric underpinnings of the
California coast. In Chapter 3, we undertake a structural study of the southern
Naukluft Mountains, and re-interpret its tectonic context and age. Chapter
4 builds a new method for applying statistical error bars to remotely measured
planar orientations, and Chapter 5 applies this method to mapping the 3D
structure of a globally significant stratigraphy on Mars. We find a long
history of interaction with water at the margin of Isidis Basin. Together,
these projects demonstrate the application of structural techniques to
continental margins on Earth and Mars, and the creation of new techniques to
support geological analysis from remotely-sensed data, where structural
measurements may be poorly resolved.

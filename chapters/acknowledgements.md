\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

This PhD was shaped by several outstanding advisors.
First and foremost, I am thrilled to have worked with Bethany Ehlmann --- and
more so to be one of her first batch of students. Bethany's focus and clear-eyed
vision allowed us to tackle some really big projects, and her high standards for
quality encouraged careful and methodical work. I am glad that she
turned my attention to Mars. John Grotzinger's guidance helped
me gain skill and confidence as a field geologist. I am grateful for his willingness
to embark on a large exploratory project with a relative novice at sedimentary geology. Finally,
Jason Saleeby helped me appreciate the true complexity of tectonics with his
intersectional style in the field and in research. Having advisors in
three different swathes of the geological sciences gave me a variety of
models of scientific outlook and
practice to draw from in my work, and I am the richer for it. Thanks for
giving me the opportunity to do so much, and the tools to succeed.

Many others on the faculty and staff have contributed greatly to this PhD. From
my thesis advisory committee, Paul Asimow was a great help with petrology, and
John Eiler asked insightful and probing questions. Joann Stock kept me on
academic track, and her field trips were amazing for their content and depth.
The field classes taught by Caltech were one of the highlights of my graduate
experience, and I especially thank Joe Kirshvink for his outsize role in
organizing them.
Several faculty and researchers, especially George Rossman, Chi Ma,
Fenfang Wu, and Yunbin Guan lent their time and energy to my analytical work.
Lisa Christiansen, Mike Black and Scott Dungan have diagnosed myriad GIS and
computer problems over the years. Ajay Limaye taught me the SOCET Set tool that
formed the basis of my Mars work, and Jay Dickson assisted with the compilation
of satellite data.
Financial support from NASA in the form of the Earth and
Space Sciences Fellowship was crucial to my graduate career. Funding and
field courses from the Agouron Foundation were crucial to expanding my focus
towards Earth history.

Janice Grancich was tireless in organizing the logistics for my
field seasons in the Naukluft Mountains, and Mark Garcia made sure we had equipment
in working order. On the ground in Namibia, Roger Swart's hospitality
was crucial to my success, and I am grateful for his friendship and that of the
entire Swart family. More broadly, I must thank the entire staff of the Geologic
Survey of Namibia and Namib-Naukluft National Park, who were extremely
accommodating towards my fieldwork. Ted Present and Alice Michel donated months
of their time to this project as my field assistants, and Ted additionally
taught me how to log stratigraphic sections of carbonate rocks. Tina Seeger was
instrumental in processing the enormous volume of stratigraphic logs and carbon
isotope samples that we generated in the field.

Over the course of all of these projects, I have benefited from many amazing
role models among the graduate students and postdocs at Caltech,
who collectively modeled collegiality and competence. These forebears are too
numerous to name, but a few rank as especially important: Frank Sousa, Jason
Price, Jena Johnson, and Erica Swanson helped me to work carefully in the field and lab, and Abby
Fraeman, Melissa Rice, Kirsten Siebach, and Rebecca Greenberger were crucial
mentors in Mars science. Just as important were the numerous friends among the
GPS community; among many, Joel Scheingross and Luca Malatesta kept me on my
bike, and Jennifer Buz, Mathieu Lapotre, and Danielle Piskorz were simply
amazing. A special shout-out goes to Claire Waller-Thomas for convincing me
to apply to Caltech.

Outside of the department, I would like to thank those who put me on the
path to this work. At UNC Chapel Hill, I am in debt to Drew Coleman for
building my interest in geology, and to Kevin Stewart for conveying the
richness of structural geology. Jeff Gillis-Davis
at the University of Hawaii was also a wonderful mentor who steered me
at crucial points. Thanks for the help!

Finally, I must thank my family --- my parents, Robert and Smita Quinn,
set the stage for this undertaking in so many ways throughout my life,
and helped me remain strong during the process.
I'm grateful for the support of my
parents-in-law Jim and Teresa Sams throughout graduate school as well.
The rest of my family has been important to
keeping me going too, especially the nascent West Coast branch headed by
Chandra Patel, who has so often provided a home away from home. Most
importantly, I must give the final credit to Beth Sams: marrying
her was one of the superlative moments of my time at Caltech.
Beth has made these last six years amazing even as graduate school dominated my life.
Beth, I know it's been a hard on you (due to my stress and long absences for fieldwork);
I am lucky to have your love and support to lean on. It's been
a series of adventures for both of us -- I look forward to our next chapter!

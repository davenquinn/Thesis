 abstract = {A series of postulated ignimbrite units is mapped in the Amazonis, Memnonia, and Aeolis quadrangles of Mars. The units cover about 2.2?106 km2 within a broad but discontinuous and irregular belt trending east?west along the highland?lowland boundary. The ignimbrites overlie parts of the western and southern aureole materials of Olympus Mons but are embayed in places by the lava plains of the lowlands. Stratigraphic relations between the basalt flows from the Tharsis Montes region and the ignimbrites are not clearly defined; crater counts suggest that the younger ignimbrites postdate the lava flows. Crater counts per square kilometer for the ignimbrites range from 7.29±1.95?10?4 to 6.36±2.01?10?5 for craters larger than 1 km in diameter. The ignimbrite materials form thick (≥100 m), extensive, relatively flat sheets that are smooth to grooved or gently undulating. Grooved surfaces appear to be yardangs and, in most places, are not alined with prevailing wind directions. The seven mapped ignimbrite units are characterized by morphologic expression, stratigraphic position, and crater counts. Similarities to ignimbrites in the Pancake Range of central Nevada include (1) rounded patches of smooth, high?albedo, nonwelded material superposed on jointed, low?albedo, welded material, (2) local complementary joint sets in welded materials, and (3) thick flow sheets of great areal extent that follow but subdue underlying topography. Four major eruptive centers occur in areas where units are thickest and where a dominant, NNW?SSE structural trend is expressed locally by unit margins, elongate collapse features, and normal faulting. A minimum volume of 3.85?106 km3 for the deposits has been calculated from thickness estimates based on shadow measurements and crater rim height relations.},

We have determined U-Pb ages of detrital zircons separated from Early Cretaceous strata of the passive margin. Although the Guyana shield is the probable source for much of the Archean, Paleoproterozoic and early Mesoproterozoic detrital zircon grains, there is a prominent age population (ca.0.95-1.2Ga) that is not easily explained as being derived from the shield. A western source in the Venezuelan and/or northern Colombian Andes is suggested for this detrital component. We propose that a Proto-Orinoco river system drained both the Guyana Shield and the Venezuelan and Colombian Andes and that branches of this river system were funneled through Triassic/Jurassic rift basins that formed during initial opening of the ProtoCaribbean Seaway. The detrital zircon age data have implications for paleogeographic reconstructions of the Caribbean region prior to the breakup of Pangea and the longevity of continental scale river systems.},

 abstract = {In order to better understand geologic fac-tors controlling pronounced regional variations in whole-rock chemistry, mineralogy, and mineral chemistry in the batholiths of California, we calculate the magmatic intensive variables fHF/fH2O, fHF/fHCl, and fO2.Regional-scale west-to-east increases in F/OH in mafic silicates, corresponding to the systematic I-WC to I-MC and I-SC progression, reflect orders-of-magnitude increase in fHF/fH2O attending pluton crystallization. Low fHF/ fH2Oof formation of western I-WC types is consistent with their derivation from low-fluorine source rocks in subducted oceanic slabs or the upper mantle. In contrast,higher fHF/fH2Oof crystallization of I-MC and I-SC types to the east implies the involvement of (1) progressively greater amounts of continental crustal source material such as biotite-bearing metamorphic rocks, their unweathered sedimentary derivatives retaining F-rich mafic minerals, or their fusion products and/or (2) source materials which become more F-rich toward the continental interior. The regional distribution of I-MC and I-SC types suggests that the Precambrian craton of western North America, or derivative sediments, may extend farther north in California and be morphologically more complex than previously thought. From seemingly out-of- place occurrences of I-WC plutons on the eastern slopes of the Sierra Nevada batholith, we infer the existence of regions where Precambrian basement was thin or absent in Mesozoic time, which prevented extensive cratonal contamination of subducted slab or upper mantle-derived magmas.New methods for estimating T-fO2 relations in the magmas demonstrate that I-SCR granites crystallize at oxygen fugacities as much as five orders of magnitude lower than those of I-WC, I-MC, and I-SC types under conditions at or below the maximum stability limit of graphite in equilibrium with a C-O-H-S gas phase. The local-scale formation of I-SCR granites in plutonic belts within specific wall-rock terranes containing highly reducing sediments or metasediments may occur by contamination of I-types with graphitic pelite or, in some cases, by the direct fusion of this reducing pelitic wall rock. The spatial distribution of I-SCR granite provinces therefore is controlled simply by wall-rock lithology.Amphibole geobarometry demonstrates a general west-to-east decrease in crystallization pressure across the Sierra Nevada batholith. In contrast, the Peninsular Ranges batholith displays a west-to-east crystallization pressure increase. The bulk of the California batholiths crystallized at pressures less than 4-5 kb and depths less than about 15-19 km. In the southern Sierra Nevada batholith, the San Gabriels, and the eastern Peninsular Ranges, however, plutons crystallized at pressures exceeding 6 kb at deep crustal levels (23 km). Reconstruction of the pre-erosion top of the batholith shows that in an east-west cross section, the central Sierra Nevada batholith was a horizontal tabular body with an aspect ratio of at least five to one.},

@article{Alados2000,
 abstract = {Clouds are the largest modulators of the solar radiative flux reaching the Earth's surface. The amount and type of cloud cover prevailing at a given time and location largely determines the amount and type of solar radiation received at the Earth's surface. This cloud radiative forcing is different for the different solar spectral bands. In this work, we analysed the influence of cloud radiative forcing over the photosynthetically active radiation. Knowledge of the photosynthetically active radiation is necessary in different applications, but due to the absence of widespread measurements of this radiometric flux, it must be estimated from available variables. Cloudless sky parametric models compute the global photosynthetically active radiation at surface level by addition of its direct beam and diffuse components. To compute this flux under all sky conditions one must consider the influence of clouds. This could be done by defining a cloud transmittance function. We have developed such a cloud transmittance function considering three different types of clouds. The efficacy of the cloud radiative forcing scheme has been tested in combination with a cloudless sky parametric model using independent data sets. For this purpose, data recorded at two radiometric stations are used. The combination of an appropriate cloudless sky parametric model with the cloud transmittance scheme provides estimates of photosynthetically active radiation with mean bias deviation about 4\% that is close to experimental errors. Comparisons with similar formulations of the cloud radiative effect over the whole solar spectrum shows the spectral dependency of the cloud radiative effect. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

 abstract = {The careful geometric analysis of minor structural detail elucidates the relationships and evolution of associated large-scale curvilinear hinge geometries, developed during WNW-directed Caledonian thrusting exposed in Neoproterozoic Moine psammites of the Moine Nappe. Reversals in the polarity of structural facing associated with minor folding, mark the position of major sheath folds which parallel transport. Upwardly convex sheaths (closing in the direction of thrust transport) cored by older gneissose basement inliers are termed culminations, whilst those opening in the transport direction (and cored by Moine psammites) are termed depressions. Sheath folds are bisected by transport parallel and foliation normal (culmination/depression) surfaces which separate not only the reversals in facing, but also delineate zones of minor fold hinge obliquity into clockwise and anticlockwise domains relative to the transport direction. The sense of obliquity of minor Z and S folds is thus dependent on position with respect to the surfaces of culmination and depression and not the fold axial surfaces. Surfaces of culmination and depression may be superimposed on original overturned antiformal and synformal folds to produce a variety of dome (culmination on antiform), saddle (depression on antiform), inverted saddle (culmination on synform) and basin (depression on synform) configurations. The curvilinear hinges of minor folds may also be asymmetrical about the transport direction and within the plane of the regional foliation to define patterns of fold hinge-line vergence. Classical concepts of fold limb vergence may thus relate to larger antiformal and synformal hinges, whilst the fold hinge-line vergence defines major curvilinear hinges associated with culminations and depressions. Major sheath folds may therefore be interpreted in terms of both minor fold hinge-line and limb vergence, coupled with fold axis obliquity and reversals in the polarity of structural facing. The ability to recognise consistent and reliable structural relationships between facing and hinge obliquity at small scales indicates that the regional deformation process forms a linked and coherent system through several orders of magnitude.},

 abstract = {The Opportunity Mars Exploration Rover found evidence for groundwater activity in the Meridiani Planum region of Mars in the form of aeolian and fluvial sediments composed of sulphate-rich grains. These sediments appear to have experienced diagenetic modification in the presence of a fluctuating water table. In addition to the extensive secondary aqueous alteration, the primary grains themselves probably derive from earlier playa evaporites. Little is known, however, about the hydrologic processes responsible for this environmental history-particularly how such extensive evaporite deposits formed in the absence of a topographic basin. Here we investigate the origin of these deposits, in the context of the global hydrology of early Mars, using numerical simulations, and demonstrate that Meridiani is one of the few regions of currently exposed ancient crust predicted to have experienced significant groundwater upwelling and evaporation. The global groundwater flow would have been driven primarily by precipitation-induced recharge and evaporative loss, with the formation of the Tharsis volcanic rise possibly playing a role through the burial of aquifers and induced global deformation. These results suggest that the deposits formed as a result of sustained groundwater upwelling and evaporation, rather than ponding within an enclosed basin. The evaporite formation coincided with a transition to more arid conditions that increased the relative impact of a deep-seated, global-scale hydrology on the surface evolution.},

 abstract = {The most prominent feature on the surface of Mars is the near-hemispheric dichotomy between the southern highlands and northern lowlands. The root of this dichotomy is a change in crustal thickness along an apparently irregular boundary, which can be traced around the planet, except where it is presumably buried beneath the Tharsis volcanic rise. The isostatic compensation of these distinct provinces and the ancient population of impact craters buried beneath the young lowlands surface suggest that the dichotomy is one of the most ancient features on the planet. However, the origin of this dichotomy has remained uncertain, with little evidence to distinguish between the suggested causes: a giant impact or mantle convection/overturn. Here we use the gravity and topography of Mars to constrain the location of the dichotomy boundary beneath Tharsis, taking advantage of the different modes of compensation for Tharsis and the dichotomy to separate their effects. We find that the dichotomy boundary along its entire path around the planet is accurately fitted by an ellipse measuring approximately 10,600 by 8,500 km, centred at 67 degrees N, 208 degrees E. We suggest that the elliptical nature of the crustal dichotomy is most simply explained by a giant impact, representing the largest such structure thus far identified in the Solar System.},

 abstract = {The Meridiani Planum region of Mars has been identified as a region of past aqueous activity by a combination of orbital and in situ observations that revealed evidence for sulfate-rich dirty evaporites formed in a playa setting. We investigate the hydrology and sedimentary record of this area using global and regional hydrological models in which groundwater flow is driven by a combination of precipitation, evaporation, and the surface topography. Groundwater evaporation results in evaporite precipitation and cementation of aeolian sediments, allowing the accumulation of deposits of substantial thickness, which then affect the subsequent patterns of groundwater flow. Hydrological activity is initially predicted to be isolated to the deepest craters and depressions, primarily within the Arabia Terra region surrounding Meridiani. As these depressions fill with sediments, the groundwater upwelling spreads laterally across broad regions of Arabia Terra, including Meridiani Planum, as well as regional topographic lows such as the northern lowlands and large impact basins. The model predictions are borne out by observations of large intracrater deposits, inverted valley networks, finely layered deposits, spectral evidence for hydrated sulfates, and pedestal craters that preserve the remnants of a much larger deposit that once covered much of Arabia Terra. The results suggest that the inferred playa at Meridiani was part of a regionally extensive zone of groundwater upwelling. This hydrological cycle requires that conditions in the late Noachian to early Hesperian must have been conducive to the existence of liquid water at the surface throughout much of the low latitudes of Mars.},

 abstract = {Opportunity has investigated in detail rocks on the rim of the Noachian age Endeavour crater, where orbital spectral reflectance signatures indicate the presence of Fe(+3)-rich smectites. The signatures are associated with fine-grained, layered rocks containing spherules of diagenetic or impact origin. The layered rocks are overlain by breccias, and both units are cut by calcium sulfate veins precipitated from fluids that circulated after the Endeavour impact. Compositional data for fractures in the layered rocks suggest formation of Al-rich smectites by aqueous leaching. Evidence is thus preserved for water-rock interactions before and after the impact, with aqueous environments of slightly acidic to circum-neutral pH that would have been more favorable for prebiotic chemistry and microorganisms than those recorded by younger sulfate-rich rocks at Meridiani Planum.},

 abstract = {Magnetic anomaly patterns in the northeast Pacific Ocean combined with plate theory in- dicate that a trench existed offshore from western North America during mid-Tertiary time and that the present episode of strike-slip motion in the San Andreas fault system origi- nated after the cessation of subduction, not earlier than 30 m.y. ago. At present, the Ameri- can and Pacific plates appear to be moving past one another parallel to the San Andreas fault at a rate of 6 cm/yr. Data concerning the late Cenozoic history of motions between these plates is inconclusive, and so 2 probable models are examined. One assumes a constant motion of 6 cm/yr throughout the late Cenozoic, whereas the other assumes that the 2 plates were fixed with respect to one another until 5 m.y. ago, at which time they broke along the San Andreas fault system and began moving at 6 cm/yr. The second model implies that the San Andreas fault took up all the motion at the boundary between the North American and Pacific plates, while the first model suggests the broader view that much of che late Cenozoic tectonic activity of western North America is related to this boundary de- :;ormation. The models make testable predic- tions for the distribution of igneous rocks and ror the total amount and timing of deformation expected. Extrapolation of the model of con- stant motions to the early Cenozoic suggests an era of slightly compressional strike-slip at the edge of North America. A major change in plate motions in late Mesozoic time is sug- gested.},

 abstract = {Principal component analysis (PCA) is widely used as a tool in (exploratory) data investigations for many different research areas such as analytical chemistry, food- and pharmaceutical-research, and multivariate statistical process control. Despite its popularity, not many results have been reported thus far on how to calculate reliable confidence interval limits in PCA estimates. And, like all other data analysis tasks, results of PCA are not complete without reasonable expectations for the parameter uncertainties, especially in the case of predictive model objectives. In this paper we will present a case study on how to calculate confidence limits based on bootstrap re-sampling. Two NIR datasets are used to build bootstrap confidence limits. The first dataset shows the effect of outliers on bootstrap confidence limits, while the second shows the bootstrap confidence limits when the data has a bimodal distribution. The different steps and choices which have to be made for the algorithm to perform correctly will be presented. The bootstrap based confidence limits will be compared with the corresponding asymptotic confidence limits. We will thereby conclude that the confidence limits based on the bootstrap method give more meaningful answers and are to be preferred over its asymptotic counterparts. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

 abstract = {Jurassic high-sulfur coals from the Maghara area in Egypt were analyzed for the abundance and isotopic composition of different forms of sulfur. Analyses indicated that the sulfur occurs in the form of organic, pyrite, and sulfate forms. Pyrite sulfur represents the major fraction, while sulfate sulfur is minor and could be formed during sample preparation for the analyses.The ??34S CDT values of the organic sulfur are positive ranging between 1.0\% and 13.5\% with an average of 9.1\%. Pyrite ??34S values are also positive ranging between 1.5\% and 15.4\% with an average of 6.6\%. The high ??34S values of the organic sulfur in the Maghara coals suggest a freshwater origin of the organic components of these coals. The lack of correlation between pyrite and organic sulfur isotopes implies different incorporation mechanisms of sulfur. The high-sulfur contents along with the positive and high ??34S values suggest a marine origin of pyrite sulfur and support the geological interpretation of marine invasion after the peat formation that was responsible for the incorporation of the pyrite sulfur.The occurrence of pyrite as euhedral crystals as well as the high and positive ??34S values of the pyrite sulfur indicates the formation of pyrite during diagenesis as a result of marine water invasion of the preexisting peat in a brackish coastal plain environment. ?? 2009 Elsevier GmbH.},

@article{Baker1999,
 abstract = {We calculated primary bulk compositions for a global suite of abyssal peridotites using primary mineral modes and either analyzed or calculated phase compositions. The latter were obtained through correlations between reported mineral compositions and modal olivine contents. Both the modal data and the mineral compositions were averaged by dredge site, drill hole, or fracture zone (FZ) depending on the amount of available data. Our calculated abyssal peridotite compositions yield major-element oxide-MgO trends that are generally in good agreement with those based on compilations of ultramafic nodules and peridotite massifs. In particular, we find no statistically significant correlation between FeO(*) (total Fe as FeO) and MgO and, therefore, no evidence for significant olivine accumulation. Previous reports of a positive correlation reflect an artifact of the regressions used to calculate missing phase compositions and result in a relationship between the Mg??? of olivine and modal olivine abundance that is inconsistent with observed variations in abyssal peridotites. There is a slight positive correlation between bulk FeO(*) and MgO if individual thin sections are used to derive the mineral composition versus modal olivine regressions, but the large sizes and heterogeneous distributions of phases within abyssal peridotites make it unlikely that individual thin section modes accurately reflect phase proportions in meter-sized dredge-haul samples. The variability of Na and Ti contents in pyroxenes from plagioclase-free abyssal peridotites suggests to us, as it has to other workers, that a majority of these samples interacted to varying degrees with small amounts of melt. On the other hand, lower bounds on Na and Ti contents in the pyroxenes at a given dredge site as a function of modal olivine content are broadly consistent with calculated partial melting residues. Thus, abyssal peridotites may retain information both on the original partial melting process and on concurrent or later interactions with partial melts from other sources.},

 abstract = {This paper reports an analysis of the thermal properties of ejecta layers of single- and double-lobe impact craters on Mars. First observations of thermal properties were made at low resolution from the Phobos'88 mission and did not allow mapping of variations of thermal properties inside the ejecta layer. The THEMIS instrument on board the Mars Odyssey mission provides new high-resolution thermal mapping of the surface of Mars. From these data we observe a systematic temperature increase at night at the edge of the ejecta. We evaluate first the possible influences on the surface temperatures at night of postimpact modification processes given the topography of an impact crater and its ejecta. We show that the observed thermal signature is more likely related to a particle size distribution inherited immediately after the impact event during the emplacement of ejecta. We propose that the kinetic sieving process, observed in experimental and natural granular flows, like pyroclastic flows, is responsible for the accumulation of larger particles at the ejecta flow front and thus is responsible for the temperature increase. Despite evidence of aeolian activity at Syrtis Major, these craters offer an example of preserved surface physical properties resulting from geological processes which have occurred since the formation of the volcanic shield of Syrtis Major. Further studies are underway with the Mars Express ongoing observations produced by the HRSC and OMEGA instruments in order to explore the interplay between the surface physical properties and the spectroscopic signatures seen at Syrtis Major.},

 abstract = {This paper focuses on the spectral characteristics of lobate ejecta across Syrtis Major volcano, a dark region of Mars presenting a mafic composition as revealed from the Observatoire pour la Mineralogie, l'Eau, les Glaces et l'Activite (OMEGA) instrument. Two spectrally distinct crater types are identified. Type I is enriched in high-calcium pyroxene (HCP) relative to the volcanic rocks. Type II is similar to the lava flow mineralogy driven by HCP, compared to the Noachian crust dominated by low-calcium pyroxene (LCP). Type I craters are systematically younger than type II. The type II mineralogy has been likely affected by a long-term weathering in a cold environment for the last 2 Ga. The axisymmetric spectral signatures of type I ejecta appear dominated by rock-forming minerals rather than by soils and reflect the composition of excavated materials offering a window for exploring the subsurface. A progressive change in the slope of the spectra around 1.5-2 mu m is observed across the ejecta layers, pointing at a change in the HCP/LCP ratio. The deconvolution of the spectra by the Modified Gaussian Model unravels a maximum of HCP/LCP band strength ratio located between 1.2 and 3 crater radii for all type I craters. Using Z-modeling, this observation translates into a maximum in the HCP/LCP abundances at a few hundreds of meters depth and suggests a homogeneous subsurface structure of the volcanic edifice. Below this horizon the HCP/LCP decrease may reveal a more ancient lava composition or the signature of the underlying Noachian crust.},

 abstract = {Crystallization products of liquids produced by partial melting of a possible Martian mantle for conditions covering the earliest Noachian era to the most recent Amazonian times have been modeled using the MELTS thermodynamic calculator. The results imply a transition from low-calcium pyroxene dominated assemblages in the Noachian to high-calcium pyroxene assemblages in the Hesperian and Amazonian, which is remarkably consistent with observations made by orbiting visible and near-infrared spectrometers. This transition is interpreted as the consequence of the thermal evolution of the mantle, with no need for exotic conditions, such as higher water content or nonchondritic Ca/Al ratio of the mantle source, to produce low-calcium pyroxene rich lithologies. Our results are compatible with numerical models of the thermal evolution of Mars that predict high production rates of crust on early Mars, implying that Noachian rocks exposed at the surface may be petrological expressions of this volcanism rather than being associated with mantle overturn following the crystallization of a magma ocean.},

@article{Bea2012,
 abstract = {Crustal melting to produce granite magmas requires a tremendous amount of energy. In principle, there are three main mechanisms of heating that can extensively melt a fertile crust: radiogenic heat caused by the decay of 40K, 230Th, 235U and 238U; increased subcrustal heat flux caused by the upwelling of deeper, therefore hotter, mantle materials; advection of heat caused by the emplacement and crystallization of hot mantle magmas. Two-dimensional finite elements modeling reveals that a fertile crust thickened to 65-70km would produce copious granite magmatism after 30-40M.y. if its average heat-production is A1.2??Wm -3, but it would scarcely melt if A0.65??Wm -3. Increasing the subcrustal heat flow from the normal value of Q M???0.025Wm -2 to Q M???0.04Wm -2 may also lead to extensive crustal melting, especially if the crust does not thin to less than 30-35km. Very high Q M (???0.06Wm -2) affecting the continental crust is unlikely, but the combination of moderately high Q M (???0.04Wm -2) and a thick fertile crust with A1.2??Wm -3, such as often happens in the volcanic and back-arc areas of subduction zones, is ideal to produce copious granite magmatism. Lastly, the emplacement of hot mantle magmas in a fertile crust can produce crustal melts in just a few thousand years, but the volume of these is equal to or less than the volume of the intruding magma. A clue for understanding the relative importance of each of these three mechanisms comes from the radiogenic heat production of granite rocks calculated from the concentration of 40K, 230Th, 235U and 238U at the time of their formation. This parameter estimated on more than 3400 granites samples of different ages and provenance reveals a strongly asymmetric distribution peaking around 2.4??Wm -3, a value much higher than the average continental crust (about 1-1.2??Wm -3) and certainly much higher than the average lower continental crust (about 0.4-0.8??Wm -3). Only those granite rock types that are clearly connected with mantle heat sources such as the Archean TTG, post-Archean subduction-related trondhjemites, and recent adakites have a heat production equal to or smaller than the lower continental crust. Since the bulk melt/solid partition coefficient of the heat-producing elements (HPE: K, Th and U) is k???1, the elevated HPE contents of granites indicates that most of them have been derived from HPE-rich sources. We conclude that radiogenic heating is often essential, and always advantageous, for generating large volumes of granite magmas, and that granite magmatism is the main cause of the accumulation of HPE in the upper crust. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

 abstract = {Fire is a key factor controlling global vegetation patterns and carbon cycling. It mostly occurs under warm periods during which fuel builds up with sufficient moisture, whereas such conditions stimulate fire ignition and spread. Biomass burning increased globally with warming periods since the last glacial era. Data confirming periglacial fires during glacial periods are very sparse because such climates are likely too cold to favour fires. Here, tree occurrence and fires during the Upper Pleistocene glacial periods in Central Canada are inferred from botanical identification and calibrated radiocarbon dates of charcoal fragments. Charcoal fragments were archived in sandy dunes of central Saskatchewan and were dated 50~000-26~600~cal BP. Fragments were mostly gymnosperms. Parallels between radiocarbon dates and GISP2-δ(18) O records deciphered relationships between fire and climate. Fires occurred either hundreds to thousands of years after Dansgaard-Oeschger (DO) interstadial warming events (i.e., the time needed to build enough fuel for fire ignition and spread) or at the onset of the DO event. The chronological uncertainties result from the dated material not precisely matching the fires and from the low residual (14) C associated with old sample material. Dominance of high-pressure systems and low effective moisture during post-DO coolings likely triggered flammable periglacial ecosystems, while lower moisture and the relative abundance of fuel overshadowed lower temperatures for fire spread. Laurentide ice sheet (LIS) limits during DO events are difficult to assess in Central Canada due to sparse radiocarbon dates. Our radiocarbon data set constrains the extent of LIS. Central Saskatchewan was not covered by LIS throughout the Upper Pleistocene and was not a continental desert. Instead, our results suggest long-lasting periods where fluctuations of the northern tree limits and fires after interstadials occurred persistently.},

 abstract = {We conducted a survey of central mounds within large (25. km diameter) impact craters on Mars. We use mound locations, mound offsets within their host craters, and relative mound heights to address and extend various mound formation hypotheses. The results of this survey support the hypothesis that mound sediments once filled their host craters and were later eroded into the features we observe today. The majority of mounds are located near the boundaries of previously identified large-scale sedimentary deposits. We discuss the implications of the hypothesis that central mounds are part of previously more extensive sedimentary units that filled and overtopped underlying impact craters. In this scenario, as erosion of the sedimentary unit occurred, the sediment within impact craters was preserved slightly longer than the overlying sediment because it was sheltered by the crater walls. Our study also reveals that most mounds are offset from the center of their host crater in the same direction as the present regional winds (e.g., the mounds in Arabia Terra are offset towards the western portion of their craters). We propose that this implies that wind has been the dominant agent causing the erosion of central mounds.},

 abstract = {A new model has been constructed for calculating the level of atmospheric CO(2) during the past 570 million years. A series of successive steady states for CO(2) is used in order to calculate CO(2) level from a feedback function for the weathering of silicate minerals. Processes considered are: sedimentary burial of organic matter and carbonates; continental weathering of silicates, carbonates, and organic matter; and volcanic and metamorphic degassing of CO(2). Sediment burial rates are calculated with the use of an isotope mass-balance model and carbon isotopic data on ancient seawater. Weathering rates are calculated from estimates of past changes in continental land area, mean elevation, and river runoff combined with estimates of the effects of the evolution of vascular land plants. Past degassing rates are estimated from changes in the rate of generation of sea floor and the shift of carbonate deposition from platforms to the deep sea. The model results indicate that CO(2) levels were high during the Mesozoic and early Paleozoic and low during the Permo-Carboniferous and late Cenozoic. These results correspond to independently deduced Phanerozoic paleoclimates and support the notion that the atmospheric CO(2) greenhouse mechanism is a major control on climate over very long time scales.},

At least two of these textures seem unique to this locality. Xenoliths display varying degrees of depletion in basaltic constituents and last equilibrated between 900 and 1000??C. A few contain coarse exsolution intergrowths of diopside and enstatite whose reconstructed composition has about 15 wt.\% CaO corresponding to an original temperature of crystallization of approximately 1400??C. The genetic relation between the three types - if such exists - is uncertain, but overall they indicate a vertically inhomogeneous upper mantle.

 abstract = {This article outlines geomorphological and tectonic elements of the Afar Depression, and discusses its evolution. A combination of far-field stress, due to the convergence of the Eurasian and Arabian plates along the Zagros Orogenic Front, and uplift of the Afar Dome due to a rising mantle plume reinforced each other to break the lithosphere of the Arabian-Nubian Shield. Thermal anomalies beneath the Arabian-Nubian Shield in the range of 150 ??C-200 ??C, induced by a rising plume that mechanically and thermally eroded the base of the mantle lithosphere and generated pulses of prodigious flood basalt since ???30 Ma. Subsequent to the stretching and thinning the Afar Dome subsided to form the Afar Depression. The fragmentation of the Arabian-Nubian Shield led to the separation of the Nubian, Arabian and Somalian Plates along the Gulf of Aden, the Red Sea and the Main Ethiopian Rift. The rotation of the intervening Danakil, East-Central, and Ali-Sabieh Blocks defined major structural trends in the Afar Depression. The Danakil Block severed from the Nubian plate at ???20 Ma, rotated anti-clockwise, translated from lower latitude and successively moved north, left-laterally with respect to Nubia. The westward propagating Gulf of Aden rift breached the Danakil Block from the Ali-Sabieh Block at ???2 Ma and proceeded along the Gulf of Tajura into the Afar Depression. The propagation and overlap of the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden along the Manda Hararo-Gobaad and Asal-Manda Inakir rifts caused clockwise rotation of the East-Central Block. Faulting and rifting in the southern Red Sea, western Gulf of Aden and northern Main Ethiopian Rift superimposed on Afar. The Afar Depression initiated as diffused extension due to far-field stress and area increase over a dome elevated by a rising plume. With time, the lithospheric extension intensified, nucleated in weak zones, and developed into incipient spreading centers. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

 abstract = {There is ample evidence of both ancient and long-lasting fluvial activity and chemical alteration in the Libya Montes region south of Isidis Basin. The region hosts Noachian to Amazonian aged surface rocks with extensive outcrops of olivine- and pyroxene-bearing material. Libya Montes also features surface outcrops and/or deposits hosting Fe/Mg-smectite, Fe/Mg-smectite mixed with carbonate and/or other Fe/Mg-rich phyllosilicates, and Al-smectite. These units likely formed through chemical alteration connected with hydrothermal activity resulting from the formation of the Isidis Basin and/or the pervasive fluvial activity throughout this region. The morphology and stratigraphy of the aqueous and mafic minerals are described using High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment and High Resolution Stereo Camera derived digital terrain models. Analyses of the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars spectra show variations in the chemistry of the Fe/Mg-smectite from nontronite-like exposures with spectral features near 2.29 and 2.4 mu m more consistent with Fe23+OH groups in the mineral structure, and saponite-like outcrops with spectral features near 2.31 and 2.38 mu m characteristic of Mg32+OH groups. These Fe/Mg-smectite bearing materials also have bands near 1.9 mu m due to H2O and near 2.5 mu m that could be due to the smectite, other phyllosilicates, and carbonates. All regions exhibiting carbonate features near 3.4-3.5 mu m also have features consistent with the presence of olivine and Fe/Mg-smectite, indicating that the carbonate signatures occur in rocks likely containing a mixture of these minerals. The Al-smectite-bearing rocks have bands near 1.41, 1.91, and 2.19 mu m that are more consistent with beidellite than other Al-phyllosilicates, indicating a higher-temperature or diagenetically processed origin for this material. Our interpretation of the geologic history of this region is that ancient Noachian basaltic crustal materials experienced extensive aqueous alteration at the time of the Isidis impact, during which the montes were also formed, followed by emplacement of a rough olivine-rich lava or melt, and finally the smooth pyroxene-bearing caprock unit.},

 abstract = {A provenance study using petrography, geochemistry and U-Pb zircon dating was carried out on selected siliciclastic units of the Nama Group, a major lithostratigraphic unit in southwestern Gondwana which crops out in southern Namibia and adjacent north-western South Africa. Petrographic and geochemical results from the Nama Group indicate a homogenous recycled upper crust composition characterized mainly by metamorphic and granitic sources, with minor input from mafic rock sources that have not undergone significant weathering. Previous works based on facies and palaeocurrent analyses, and silicified volcanic ash beds and chromian spinel bearing sandstones of the Nama Basin points to a syn-tectonic volcanic island arc source located in the adjacent Damara Belt. U-Pb detrital zircon geochronology of the Nama Group rocks displays major peaks at Neoproterozoic (Pan-African orogeny) and Mesoproterozoic (Namaqua-Natal orogeny) indicating a foreland geotectonic setting for Nama deposition, confirming facies and palaeocurrents analyses. A paleocurrent shift from the north to the west in the upper "molassic" Nama Group is associated with a switch to an influx of Neoproterozoic-Cambrian detrital zircons (76\%). These ages probably indicate exhumation (after 531 ± 9 Ma) of a felsic volcanic arc (Arachania) root, which is presently attached to the Ŕio de la Plata Craton. The provenance of the Nama foreland basin suggests that continent-continent collision of the Kalahari/Congo Cratons and the Cuchilla Dionisio Pelotas Terrane (Arachania Arc) with the Ŕio de la Plata Craton most likely occurred due to strike-slip accretion related to a component of N-S shortening in the period between 530 and 495.

 abstract = {Advances in analytical geochemistry have made it possible to determine precisely the concentration of many trace elements and their isotopes in rocks. These data provide the cornerstone for geochemical models of the Earth and terrestrial planets. However, our understanding of how trace elements behave has not kept pace with the analytical advances. As a result, geochemists are often hampered in their interpretation of geochemical data by an incomplete knowledge of trace element partitioning under the conditions of interest. Through advances in trace element microbeam analysis it is now possible to determine partition coefficients experimentally under important conditions, such as during melting of the crust and mantle. This large body of experimental data can be used to investigate the fundamental controls on element partitioning. Simple continuum theories of elastic strain and point charges in crystal lattices, that account, respectively, for mismatch in ionic radius and ionic charge between the substituent trace ion and the lattice site on which it is accommodated, provide a very useful theoretical framework. This approach can be used as the basis for quantitative models of trace element partitioning, in terms of pressure, temperature, redox state and composition, and as a means of predicting partition coefficients for elements not routinely analysed. Experimental studies of partitioning are supported by atomistic computer simulations at zero K. Developments in computational techniques that enable direct simulation of high temperature and pressure mineral-melt partitioning will revolutionise the field in the near future. Use of novel, spectroscopic techniques to probe the structural environment of trace elements in crystals and glasses will provide valuable new data for computational and theoretical models. Extension of high temperature partitioning theory to ambient conditions is an essential step in understanding current climate change proxies, and tackling a host of environmental problems. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

 abstract = {Explosive volcanic eruptions are driven by exsolution of H2O-rich vapour from silicic magma. Eruption dynamics involve a complex interplay between nucleation and growth of vapour bubbles and crystallization, generating highly nonlinear variation in the physical properties of magma as it ascends beneath a volcano. This makes explosive volcanism difficult to model and, ultimately, to predict. A key unknown is the temperature variation in magma rising through the sub-volcanic system, as it loses gas and crystallizes en route. Thermodynamic modelling of magma that degasses, but does not crystallize, indicates that both cooling and heating are possible. Hitherto it has not been possible to evaluate such alternatives because of the difficulty of tracking temperature variations in moving magma several kilometres below the surface. Here we extend recent work on glassy melt inclusions trapped in plagioclase crystals to develop a method for tracking pressure-temperature-crystallinity paths in magma beneath two active andesite volcanoes. We use dissolved H2O in melt inclusions to constrain the pressure of H2O at the time an inclusion became sealed, incompatible trace element concentrations to calculate the corresponding magma crystallinity and plagioclase-melt geothermometry to determine the temperature. These data are allied to ilmenite-magnetite geothermometry to show that the temperature of ascending magma increases by up to 100 degrees C, owing to the release of latent heat of crystallization. This heating can account for several common textural features of andesitic magmas, which might otherwise be erroneously attributed to pre-eruptive magma mixing.},

@article{Bohannon1995,
 abstract = {The Pacific plate moved northwest relative to North America since 42 Ma. The rapid half rate of Pacific-Farallon spreading allowed the ridge to approach the continent at about 29 Ma. Extinct spreading ridges that occur offshore along 65\% of the margin (Lonsdale, 1991) document that fragments of the subducted Farallon slab became captured by the Pacific plate and assumed its motion prior to the actual subduction of the spreading ridge. This platecapture process can be used to explain much of the post29 Ma Cordilleran North America extension, strike slip, and the inland jump of oceanic spreading in the Gulf of California. The Pacific and North American contact zone lengthened with each successive plate capture event, underpinning the parts of western North America directly inland with a strong plate undergoing Pacific relative motion. We suggest that much of the post29 Ma continental tectonism is the result of the strong traction imposed on the deep part of the continental crust by the gently inclined slab of subducted oceanic lithosphere as it moved to the northwest relative to the overlying continent. The platecapture hypothesis is distinctly different from theories involving shallow slab gaps. Kinematic problems associated with shallow slab-gap models cause us to question them. This conclusion is consistent with seismic refraction interpretations that suggest there is an inclined layer with high velocities like that of basalt or gabbro at the base of the continental crust beneath much of the Californian margin and the documented reduction of slab-pull forces and density associated with young subducting slabs. Thermal and rheologic modeling suggests that coastal California was a strong zone at all depths allowing it to be firmly linked to Pacific motion. Our model shows that deformed regions such as the basin and range and borderland provinces developed in predicted weak parts of the crustal section, but they have been incompletely linked to the deep plate across the ductile middle and lower crustal layer.},

 abstract = {Plagioclase peridotites are important markers of processes that characterize the petrological and tectonic evolution of the lithospheric mantle in extensional tectonic settings. Studies on equilibrated plagioclase peridotites have documented continuous chemical changes in mantle minerals in response to plagioclase crystallization, potentially tracing the re-equilibration of mantle peridotites up to very low pressure. This experimental study provides new constraints on the stability of plagioclase in mantle peridotites as a function of bulk composition, and the compositional and modal changes in minerals occurring within the plagioclase stability field as a function of P-T-bulk composition. Subsolidus experiments have been performed at pressures ranging from 0\{middle dot\}25 to 1\{middle dot\}0 GPa, and temperatures ranging from 900 to 1200\{degrees\}C on fertile and depleted anhydrous lherzolites modelled in the system TiO2-Cr2O3-Na2O-CaO-FeO-MgO-Al2O3-SiO2 (Ti,Cr-NCFMAS). In the fertile lherzolite (Na2O/CaO = 0\{middle dot\}08; XCr = 0\{middle dot\}07) a plagioclase-bearing assemblage is stable up to 0\{middle dot\}7 GPa, 1000\{degrees\}C and 0\{middle dot\}8 GPa, 1100\{degrees\}C, whereas in the depleted lherzolite (Na2O/CaO = 0\{middle dot\}09; XCr = 0\{middle dot\}10) the upper limit of plagioclase stability is shifted to lower pressure. The boundary between plagioclase lherzolite and spinel lherzolite has a positive slope in P-T space. In a complex chemical system, the plagioclase-out boundary is multivariant and sensitive to the XCr value [XCr = Cr/(Cr + Al)] of spinel. This latter is controlled by the reaction MgCr2O4 + CaAl2Si2O8 = MgCrAlSiO6 + CaCrAlSiO6, which is a function of the Cr-Al partitioning between spinel and pyroxenes, and varies with the XCr value and chromite/anorthite normative ratio of the bulk composition. Within the plagioclase stability field, the Al content of pyroxenes decreases, coupled with an increase in the anorthite content in plagioclase, and Ti and XCr in spinel with decreasing pressure; these chemical variations are combined with systematic changes in modal mineralogy governed by a continuous reaction involving both plagioclase and spinel. As a consequence, the composition of plagioclase varies significantly over a rather narrow pressure range and is similar at the same P-T conditions in the investigated bulk-rocks. This suggests the potential application of plagioclase composition as a geobarometer for plagioclase peridotites.},

 abstract = {The Tharsis region is the largest volcanic complex on Mars and in the Solar System. Young lava flows cover its surface (from the Amazonian period, less than 3 billion years ago) but its growth started during the Noachian era (more than 3.7 billion years ago). Its position has induced a reorientation of the planet with respect to its spin axis (true polar wander, TPW), which is responsible for the present equatorial position of the volcanic province. It has been suggested that the Tharsis load on the lithosphere influenced the orientation of the Noachian/Early Hesperian (more than 3.5 billion years ago) valley networks and therefore that most of the topography of Tharsis was completed before fluvial incision. Here we calculate the rotational figure of Mars (that is, its equilibrium shape) and its surface topography before Tharsis formed, when the spin axis of the planet was controlled by the difference in elevation between the northern and southern hemispheres (hemispheric dichotomy). We show that the observed directions of valley networks are also consistent with topographic gradients in this configuration and thus do not require the presence of the Tharsis load. Furthermore, the distribution of the valleys along a small circle tilted with respect to the equator is found to correspond to a southern-hemisphere latitudinal band in the pre-TPW geographical frame. Preferential accumulation of ice or water in a south tropical band is predicted by climate model simulations of early Mars applied to the pre-TPW topography. A late growth of Tharsis, contemporaneous with valley incision, has several implications for the early geological history of Mars, including the existence of glacial environments near the locations of the pre-TPW poles of rotation, and a possible link between volcanic outgassing from Tharsis and the stability of liquid water at the surface of Mars.},

 abstract = {Geochemical analyses and geobarometric determinations have been combined to create a depth vs. radiogenic heat production database for the Sierra Nevada batholith, California. This database shows that mean heat production values first increase, then decrease, with increasing depth. Heat production is ???2 ??W/m3 within the ???3-km-thick volcanic pile at the top of the batholith, below which it increases to an average value of ???3.5 ??W/m3 at ???5.5 km depth, then decreases to ???0.5-1 ??W/m3 at ???15 km depth and remains at these values through the entire crust below 15 km. Below the crust, from depths of ???40-125 km, the batholith's root and mantle wedge that coevolved beneath the batholith appears to have an average radiogenic heat production rate of ???0.14 ??W/m3. This is higher than the rates from most published xenolith studies, but reasonable given the presence of crustal components in the arc root assemblages. The pattern of radiogenic heat production interpreted from the depth vs. heat production database is not consistent with the downward-decreasing exponential distribution predicted from modeling of surface heat flow data. The interpreted distribution predicts a reasonable range of geothermal gradients and shows that essentially all of the present day surface heat flow from the Sierra Nevada could be generated within the ???35 km thick crust. This requires a very low heat flux from the mantle, which is consistent with a model of cessation of Sierran magmatism during Laramide flat-slab subduction, followed by conductive cooling of the upper mantle for ???70 m.y. The heat production variation with depth is principally due to large variations in uranium and thorium concentration; potassium is less variable in concentration within the Sierran crust, and produces relatively little of the heat in high heat production rocks. Because silica content is relatively constant through the upper ???30 km of the Sierran batholith, while U, Th, and K concentrations are highly variable, radiogenic heat production does not vary directly with silica content. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

 abstract = {As inferred from orbital spectroscopic data, Northeast Syrtis Major bears considerable mineral diversity that spans the Noachian-Hesperian boundary despite its small geographic area. In this study we use observations from the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment, supplemented with Context Camera imagery, to characterize and map the lateral extent of geomorphic units in Northeast Syrtis Major, and constrain the geomorphic context of the orbital-identified mineral signatures. Using recent observations, we confirm previous mineralogy identified with the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars, and greatly extend the lateral extent of visible to near-infrared investigation utilizing the greater coverage. Analysis of Thermal Emission Imaging System observations reveals further physical properties and distribution of the geomorphic units. The stratigraphy, which spans the Noachian-Hesperian boundary, displays significant morphological heterogeneity at the decameter scale, but it is unifiable under five distinct geomorphic units. Our paired morphological and mineralogical analysis allows us to construct a detailed geological history of Northeast Syrtis Major. Several geological events that occurred in Northeast Syrtis Major—including the formation of the post-Isidis crust, the emplacement of an olivine-rich unit, the formation of sulfate minerals, and the emplacement of the Syrtis Major Volcanics—can be related to regional and global processes constraining the local chronology. Other mineralogical indicators, particularly the formation of Al-phyllosilicates, are difficult to place in the temporal sequence. They are observed in isolated patches on the post-Isidis crust, not as a distinct stratigraphic unit as observed elsewhere in Nili Fossae, suggesting their formation via isolated leaching or through alteration of initial compositional heterogeneities within the crust. Exposures of an olivine-rich unit are intermittently observed to form quasi-circular landforms, suggestive of emplacement in circular depressions, which may indicate a period of cratering between the formation of the Isidis basin and the deposition of the olivine-rich unit. We identify and discuss intriguing large linear features of the olivine-rich unit, reminiscent of dyke-fed volcanism, that have raised bounding ridges suggestive of contact metamorphism with the crust. We compile, review, and discuss many of the outstanding questions and running hypotheses relevant to our mapping area. A synthesis of our geomorphic mapping with recent literature reveals a well-defined geological history with extensive aqueous activity at Northeast Syrtis Major that is amassed in a stratigraphic sequence spanning a time likely greater than 250 million years of geological history. Our geomorphic and spectral analyses confirm that Northeast Syrtis Major exhibits considerable geomorphic and mineralogic diversity within a relatively small geographic area that is representative of the geologic processes occurring throughout the broader Nili Fossae region during the Noachian and Hesperian. Northeast Syrtis Major adds to this sequence by exposing the diverse environmental history of this region as observed through the presence of alteration minerals not present in this fidelity or proximity elsewhere in Nili Fossae.},

 abstract = {Dust is an abundant material on Mars, and there is strong evidence that it is a contributor to the rock record as ‘‘duststone,'' analogous in many ways to loess on Earth. Although a common suite of dust formation mechanisms has operated on the two planets, fundamental differences in environments and geologic histories have resulted in vastly different weighting functions, causing distinct depositional styles and erosional mechanisms. On Earth, dust is derived predominantly from glacial grinding and, in nonglacial environments, by other processes, such as volcanism, eolian abrasion, and fluvial comminution. Hydrological and biological processes convert dust accumulations to loess deposits. Active hydrology also acts to clean dust from the atmosphere and convert loess into soil or erode it entirely. On Mars, glacial production of dust has been minor,with most fine particles probably produced from ancient volcanic, impact, and fluvial processes. Dust is deposited under arid conditions in which aggregate growth and cementation are the stabilizing agents. Thick accumulations result in duststone.},

 abstract = {This report was prepared as part of the World Energy Project of the U.S. Geological Survey. The purpose of the World Energy Project is to assess the quantities of oil, gas, and natural gas liquids that have the potential to be added to reserves within the next 30 years. These volumes either reside in undiscovered fields whose sizes exceed the stated minimum field-size cutoff value for the assessment unit (variable, but must be at least 1 million barrels of oil equivalent) or reside in fields already discovered and will subsequently be identified as reserve growth. For this project, the world was divided into eight regions and 937 geologic provinces, which were then ranked according to the discovered oil and gas volumes within each (Klett and others, 1997). Of these, 76 “priority” provinces (exclusive of the United States and chosen for their high ranking) and 26 “boutique” provinces (exclusive of the United States and chosen for their anticipated petroleum richness or special regional economic importance) were selected for appraisal of oil and gas resources. A geologic province characteristically has dimensions of hundreds of kilometers and encompasses a natural geologic entity (for example, sedimentary basin, thrust belt, accreted terrane) or some combination of contiguous geologic entities. Province boundaries were generally drawn along natural geologic boundaries, although in some provinces the boundary location was based on other factors such as a specific bathymetric depth in open oceans. The total petroleum system constitutes the basic geologic unit of the oil and gas assessment. The total petroleum system includes all genetically related petroleum that occurs in shows and accumulations (discovered and undiscovered) that (1) has been generated by a pod or by closely related pods of mature source rock and (2) exists within a limited mappable geologic space, along with the other essential mappable geologic elements (reservoir, seal, and overburden rocks) that control the fundamental processes of generation, expulsion, migration, entrapment, and preservation of petroleum. An assessment unit is a mappable part of a total petroleum system in which discovered and undiscovered fields constitute a single, relatively homogeneous population such that the chosen resource-assessment methodology, based on estimation of the number and sizes of undiscovered fields, is applicable. A total petroleum system may equate to a single assessment unit, or, if necessary, may be subdivided into two or more assessment units such that each unit is sufficiently homogeneous in terms of geology, exploration considerations, and risk to assess individually. A graphical depiction of the elements of a total petroleum system is provided in the form of an events chart that shows the times of (1) deposition of essential rock units; (2) trap formation; (3) generation, migration, and accumulation of hydrocarbons; and (4) preservation of hydrocarbons. A numeric code identifies each region, province, total petroleum system, and assessment unit; these codes are uniform throughout the project and throughout all publications of the project. The codes for all the world's regions and oil and gas provinces are listed in Klett and others (1997).},

 abstract = {Based on theoretical grounds, explosive basaltic volcanism should be common on Mars, yet the available morphological evidence is sparse. We test this hypothesis by investigating a unique unnamed volcanic field north of the shield volcanoes Biblis Patera and Ulysses Patera on Mars, where we observe several small conical edifices and associated lava flows. Twenty-nine volcanic cones are identified and the morphometry of many of these edifices is determined using established morphometric parameters such as basal width, crater width, height, slope, and their respective ratios. Their morphology, morphometry, and a comparison to terrestrial analogues suggest that they are martian equivalents of terrestrial pyroclastic cones, the most common volcanoes on Earth. The cones are tentatively interpreted as monogenetic volcanoes. According to absolute model age determinations, they formed in the Amazonian period. Our results indicate that these pyroclastic cones were formed by explosive activity. The cone field is superposed on an old, elevated window of fractured crust which survived flooding by younger lava flows. It seems possible that a more explosive eruption style was common in the past, and that wide-spread effusive plain-style volcanism in the Late Amazonian has buried much of its morphological evidence in Tharsis. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

 abstract = {Terrestrial laser scanning, or lidar, is a recent innovation in spatial information data acquisition, which allows geological outcrops to be digitally captured with unprecedented resolution and accuracy. With point precisions and spacing of the order of a few centimetres, an enhanced quantitative element can now be added to geological fieldwork and analysis, opening up new lines of investigation at a variety of scales in all areas of field-based geology. Integration with metric imagery allows 3D photorealistic models to be created for interpretation, visualization and education. However, gaining meaningful results from lidar scans requires more than simply acquiring raw point data. Surveys require planning and, typically, a large amount of postprocessing time. The contribution of this paper is to provide a more detailed insight into the technology, data collection and utilization techniques than is currently available. The paper focuses on the workflow for using lidar data, from the choice of field area and survey planning, to acquiring and processing data and, finally, extracting geologically useful data. Because manufacturer specifications for point precision are often optimistic when applied to real-world outcrops, the error sources associated with lidar data, and the implications of them propagating through the processing chain, are also discussed.},

 abstract = {Geological studies support the interpretation that northern Panamint Valley and Saline Valley, southeast California, form paired pull-apart basins on opposite sides of the right-slip Hunter Mountain Fault Zone. Eight to ten km of late Cenozoic net slip can be established on the Hunter Mountain Fault Zone. Palinspastic reconstruction of northern Panamint Valley indicates that the valley was formed by movement on a shallow crustal, low-angle normal fault of 0\&\#8211;15 degree west dip during the last 3.0 Ma. This interpretation appears to contradict the notions that little extension is accomodated in the uppermost crust by low-angle faulting and that the most recent extension in the Basin and Range Province is accomodated exclusively by high-angle faulting. Saline Valley, however, is interpreted to have formed by extension on closely spaced, rotated planar normal faults. Thus, within one geometric system of paired pull-apart basins, extension appears to have been accommodated in the shallow crust in two different ways.},

 abstract = {Catastrophic filling of the kind of subsea-level depression commonly formed during ocean opening and ocean closing is the only mechanism, other than glacial eustacy, capable of rapidly lowering sea level. Aptian evaporites overlying oceanic crust on both sides of the South Atlantic between the Walvis Ridge and the Niger Delta were deposited in such a basin by repeated spilling of ocean water. The final flooding of the South Atlantic north of the Walvis Ridge extracted about 14 x 10 to the 8th cu km of sea water from the world ocean and effected about 10 m of sea-level lowering. It is speculated that the middle Aptian unconformity, which is one of the more prominent world-wide unconformities, is associated with this sea-level drop of about 10 m. A corollary of this interpretation is that if the catastrophic sea-level lowerings during the Mesozoic era had amplitudes substantially greater than 10 m, then a glacial mechanism to explain them would seem inescapable although the stratigraphic record has not yet yielded any evidence of such glaciation.},

Through ordination altitude, clay, potassium content of the substrate and, to a lesser extent, habitats were identified as underlying environmental factors determining the composition of these plant communities.

 abstract = {The approach of a buoyant spreading ridge to a subduction zone may lead to detachment of a subducted slab. Previous work has called upon the detachment process as an explanation for observed ridge abandonment and slab window related magmatism (e.g., in Baja California), but such a scenario has not been tested using fully dynamic numerical models. We use dynamic two-dimensional models including a non-Newtonian rheology to study the approach of a trench-parallel spreading ridge to a subduction zone. We find that before the ridge approaches within 100 km of the trench, detachment of the subducted slab occurs due to the combined effects of increased buoyancy and reduced strength of the lithosphere with ridge proximity. In models exploring effects of subducted slab length, distance of the ridge from the trench, shear zone strength, and lithospheric yield strength, we find the following: (1) a decrease in subduction velocity as the ridge approaches the trench, (2) a shrinking surface plate that maintains a uniform plate-like subduction velocity, (3) ridge abandonment distances 100–275 km from the trench, and (4) slab gap distances 195–285 km from the trench. These results are consistent with observations in Baja California, where detachment of the Cocos slab may explain abandonment of observed segments of the East Pacific Rise 50–200 km outboard of the trench and the presence of nonarc related magmatism located 100–250 km inboard of the trench. Ridge subduction does not occur within any of these two-dimensional cases of ridge-trench collision, indicating that 3-D geometric effects may be responsible for ridge subduction.},

We generated an average illumination map for the year 2020 for the lunar south pole region. From this we identified the areas that receive the most illumination. The place receiving the most illumination (86\% of the year) is located close to the rim of Shackleton crater at 88.74°S 124.5°E. However two other areas, less than 10 km apart from each other, are collectively lit for 94\% of the year. We found that sites exist near the south pole that are continuously lit for several months during summer. We were also able to map the locations and durations of eclipse periods for these areas. Finally we analyzed the seasonal variations in lighting conditions, from summer to winter, for key areas near the south pole. We conclude that areas exist near the south pole that have illumination conditions that make them ideal candidates as future outpost sites.},

These predictable patterns of sediment deposition can be used to infer changes in basin accommodation regardless of the mechanism of deposition (e.g. fluvial, lacustrine, or aeolian). Here, we analyze sedimentary deposits from three craters (Becquerel Crater, Danielson Crater, Crater A) in Arabia Terra. Each crater contains layered deposits that are clearly observed in orbital images. Although orbital images are insufficient to specifically determine the origin of sedimentary deposits, depositional couplets can be interpreted in terms of potential accommodation space available for deposition, and changes in the distribution of couplet thickness through stratigraphy can be interpreted in terms of changing base level and the production of new accommodation space. Differences in stratal packaging in these three craters suggest varying relationships between sedimentary influx, sedimentary base level, and concomitant changes in accommodation space. Previous groundwater upwelling models hypothesize that layered sedimentary deposits were deposited under warm climate conditions of early Mars. Here, we use observed stacking patterns to propose a model for deposition under cold climate conditions, wherein episodic melting of ground ice could raise local base level, stabilize sediment deposition, and result in differential cementation of accumulated strata. Such analysis demonstrates that a first-order understanding of sedimentary deposition and accumulation-despite a lack of textural information that inhibits interpretation of depositional mechanism-can provide insight into potentially changeable depositional conditions of early Mars.},

 abstract = {Shackleton crater at the Moon's south pole has been suggested as a possible site of concentrated deposits of water ice, on the basis of modelling of bi-static radar polarization properties and interpretations of earlier Earth-based radar images. This suggestion, and parallel assumptions about other topographic cold traps, is a significant element in planning for future lunar landings. Hydrogen enhancements have been identified in the polar regions, but these data do not identify the host species or its local distribution. The earlier Earth-based radar data lack the resolution and coverage for detailed studies of the relationship between radar scattering properties, cold traps in permanently shadowed areas, and local terrain features such as the walls and ejecta of small craters. Here we present new 20-m resolution, 13-cm-wavelength radar images that show no evidence for concentrated deposits of water ice in Shackleton crater or elsewhere at the south pole. The polarization properties normally associated with reflections from icy surfaces in the Solar System were found at all the observed latitudes and are strongly correlated with the rock-strewn walls and ejecta of young craters, including the inner wall of Shackleton. There is no correlation between the polarization properties and the degree of solar illumination. If the hydrogen enhancement observed by the Lunar Prospector orbiter indicates the presence of water ice, then our data are consistent with the ice being present only as disseminated grains in the lunar regolith.},

 abstract = {Orthogonal regression is one of the standard linear regression methods to correct for the effects of measurement error in predictors. We argue that orthogonal regression is often misused in errors-in-variables linear regression because of a failure to account for equation errors. The typical result is to overcorrect for measurement error, that is, overestimate the slope, because equation error is ignored. The use of orthogonal regression must include a careful assessment of equation error, and not merely the usual (often informal) estimation of the ratio of measurement error variances. There are rarer instances, for example, an example from geology discussed here, where the use of orthogonal regression without proper attention to modeling may lead to either overcorrection or undercorrection, depending on the relative sizes of the variances involved. Thus our main point, which does not seem to be widely appreciated, is that orthogonal regression, just like any measurement error analysis, requires careful modeling of error.},

 abstract = {Lakes and lake deposits present two fundamental paradoxes: (1) Modern lakes are vastly complicated, but the rock records of lakes are relatively simple; extensive observations reveal three distinct facies associations of common and widespread occurrence. These are referred to here as fluvial-lacustrine, fluctuating profundal, and evaporative facies associations. (2) Most explanations of modern and ancient lakes attribute their nature to climate, but neither modern lake parameters (lake size, depth, and salinity) nor the character of ancient-lake strata (thickness, extent, lithology) correlate with measured or inferred climatic humidity. We propose that it is the relative balance of rates of potential accommodation (mostly tectonic) with sediment + water fill (mostly a function of climate) that controls lake occurrence, distribution, and character. Lake basins may be termed overfilled, balanced fill, or underfilled, depending on the balance between these rates. We conclude that climate and tectonics exert coequal influence on lake deposits at both mesoscales (1 m to hundreds of meters) and macroscales (hundreds to thousands of meters).},

Herein we describe three depositionat environments and their lithofacies which have not previously been described in any great detail, but constitute an Integral part of the succession. These are the algal swamp, marginal (shoreface and carbonate mudflat) and shallow evaporitic lacustrine environments and their lithofacies. Algal swamp lithofacies are characterized by kerogenous mudstones and inorganically precipitated nodular and phyllold or stromatolite algal carbonates. Marginal lacustrine lithofacies are represented by two dis- tinctive assemblages, namely carbonate mudflat and shoreface lithofacies. The former are characterized by dolomltic shales and interbeds of argillaceous limestones, aphanitic dolostones, siltstones and rare kerogenous and sub-kerogenous mudstones. The latter are characterized by 0.5-lm thick sandstones and interbedded shales or mudstones. Both exhibit evidence of ephemeral exposure. Evaporitic lacustrine lithofacies are characterized by halite, gypsum, glauberite, anhydrite and dolostone with associated shales and siltstones containing molds of evaporite minerals replaced by calcite. Using surface and available drill data an assessment of the spatial distribution, both within the Moncton Subbasin itself and with respect to associated depositional environments, of these lithofacies is made.},

 abstract = {The unique low-temperature sensitivity of the apatite (U-Th)/He (AHe) technique provides valuable new information relating to the late-stage thermal evolution of metamorphic core complexes in the southern Basin and Range Province. In all the ranges studied, the data show greater complexity than previously seen from other thermochronometers. In the Chemehuevi and northern Sacramento Mountains, a trend of decreasing ages toward the northeast applies only for the structurally shallowest parts of the footwall. This is followed by essentially age-invariant segments of 15 +/- 1 Ma, reflecting an increase in the rate of detachment fault movement. The timing of the change suggested by the data agrees with recently published AHe results from the nearby Harcuvar Mountains, located similar to 125 km to the southeast, suggesting that an underlying regional mechanism triggered this change. Plate reconstructions indicate that the Pioneer-Mendocino fracture zone migrated northward through the area at this time, leaving a slab window in its wake. We suggest that the additional heat applied to the base of the lithosphere from the slab window resulted in mechanical weakening of the area and that this, combined with the extensional strain regime present, resulted in an increased rate of slip within the actively extending metamorphic core complexes. This agrees well with timing constraints for extension onset in the central Basin and Range Province of southern Nevada, and suggests that weakening of the southern Basin and Range Province at 15 +/- 1 Ma was partially responsible for the onset of extension in the central Basin and Range. These findings demonstrate that improved constraints on changes in extension rate within the Basin and Range Province should be possible through the application of the AHe technique to other metamorphic core complex footwalls.},

 abstract = {This paper describes the geometry and strain characteristics of a complex system of small extensional faults affecting Lower Tertiary mudrock-dominated successions throughout the central North Sea Basin. Structural mapping using three-dimensional seismic data shows that the fault trace geometry is polygonal. The shallow origin of the faults is confirmed by the recognition of growth sequences developed in their hangingwalls. Line balancing techniques were used to measure the extensional strain in two survey areas. This was found to be radially isotropic in the map plane. Extension in any line of section was found to vary from 6 to 19\%. Since the deformation is clearly layer-bound and there is no evidence for displacement transfer to basement structures, it is argued that the only explanation for this apparent extension is by layer-parallel volumetric contraction. This is believed to occur in response to fluid expulsion from the mudrocks during early compaction. The conditions for failure may be achieved through increased pore fluid pressure or through tensile stresses generated as a result of pore fluid loss, or a combination of these two processes. Far-field tectonic stresses are not considered to be responsible for the formation of this fault system.},

 abstract = {Polygonal fault systems (PFS) are widely developed along many continental margin basins and some interior cratonic and foreland basins. They are networks of small normal faults that are usually found in tiers which are crudely layer-bound successions consisting mainly of fine-grained sediments. Their origin has been widely debated with explanations ranging from dewatering of overpressured layers to gravitational loading under fixed lateral boundary conditions. Their distribution in fine-grained intervals suggests that their genesis is connected to their initial lithology. Recent experimental work suggests that diagenesis of clay-rich sediments can lead to shear failure under low confining stresses. This explanation accords well with all subsurface observations of PFS made to date, and seems the most likely mechanism to explain their genesis. This diagenetic mode of shear fracturing in fine-grained sediments could be much more prevalent than in polygonal fault systems alone, and this has significant implications for shale gas exploration, CO2 sequestration and exploration for methane hydrates. © 2011.},

 abstract = {Seafloor spreading causes abundant magmatism along active ocean spreading centers, but the cause of magmatism along fossil spreading centers is enigmatic. Samples collected from Davidson Seamount, a typical volcanic ridge along an abandoned spreading center in the eastern Pacific, consist of an alkalic basalt to trachyte lava series; transitional basalts were sampled from another part of the abandoned axis, 20 km from the seamount. All samples experienced complex fractional crystallization prior to eruption, but they all share a common, compositionally heterogeneous mantle source. The parental magmas of the transitional basalts were produced from this source at higher degree of melting than those of the alkalic lava series. The composition of Davidson lavas overlaps with those of ridges along other fossil spreading centers and isolated near- and off-ridge seamounts in the eastern Pacific. Together they define a compositional continuum ranging from tholeiitic, normal mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB)-like to alkalic, ocean island basalt (OIB)-like, similar to lavas that form linear island chains and ridges. We propose that this entire compositional spectrum of intraplate lavas that do not form linear volcanic chains in the eastern Pacific results from variations in the degree of partial melting of a common, compositionally heterogeneous mantle source. This source consists of more easily melted, geochemically enriched components of varying sizes and amounts embedded in a depleted lherzolitic matrix. Large degree of partial melting produces normal MORB\&\#8211;like melts represented by some near-ridge seamount lavas, whereas small degree of melting produces OIB-like fossil spreading center lavas. The small degree of partial melting beneath recently abandoned spreading centers results from either buoyancy-driven decompression melting of the hot lithospheric and asthenospheric mantle material beneath active spreading centers or rapid motion, with respect to the underlying asthenosphere, of abandoned spreading axes that are thickening over a fertile mantle. Mid-Tertiary volcanic rocks in coastal California, which are compositionally akin to intraplate lavas, are interpreted to be small degree partial melts of the same compositionally heterogeneous sub-Pacific mantle that has upwelled through windows in a subducted slab.},

We divide Juventae Chasma into geomorphic units of (i) chasm wall rock, (ii) heavily cratered hummocky terrain, (iii) a mobile and largely crater-free sand sheet on the chasm floor, (iv) light-toned layered outcrop (LLO) material, and (v) chaotic terrain. Using surface temperatures derived from THEMIS infrared data and slopes from MOLA, we derive maps of thermal inertia, which are consistent with the geomorphic units that we identify. LLO thermal inertias range from ???400 to 850 J m-2 K-1s-1/2. Light-toned layered outcrops are distributed over a remarkably wide elevation range (??? 5.8 km) from the chasm floor to the adjacent plateau surface. Geomorphic features, the absence of small craters, and high thermal inertia show that the LLOs are composed of sedimentary rock that is eroding relatively rapidly in the present epoch. We also present evidence for exhumation of LLO material from the west wall of the chasm, within chaotic and hummocky terrains, and within a small depression in the adjacent plateau. The data imply that at least some of the LLO material was deposited long before the adjacent Hesperian plateau basalts, and that Juventae Chasma underwent, and may still be undergoing, enlargement along its west wall due to wall rock collapse, chaotic terrain evolution, and exposure and removal of LLO material. The new data allow us to reassess possible origins of the LLOs. Gypsum, one of the minerals reported elsewhere as found in Juventae Chasma LLO material, forms only at low temperatures (60 ??C) and thus excludes a volcanic origin. Instead, the data are consistent with either multiple occurrences of lacustrine or airfall deposition over an extended period of time prior to emplacement of Hesperian lava flows on the plateau above the chasm. ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc.

 abstract = {Skip to Next Section
Accretionary orogens form at intraoceanic and continental margin convergent plate boundaries. They include the supra-subduction zone forearc, magmatic arc and back-arc components. Accretionary orogens can be grouped into retreating and advancing types, based on their kinematic framework and resulting geological character. Retreating orogens (e.g. modern western Pacific) are undergoing long-term extension in response to the site of subduction of the lower plate retreating with respect to the overriding plate and are characterized by back-arc basins. Advancing orogens (e.g. Andes) develop in an environment in which the overriding plate is advancing towards the downgoing plate, resulting in the development of foreland fold and thrust belts and crustal thickening. Cratonization of accretionary orogens occurs during continuing plate convergence and requires transient coupling across the plate boundary with strain concentrated in zones of mechanical and thermal weakening such as the magmatic arc and back-arc region. Potential driving mechanisms for coupling include accretion of buoyant lithosphere (terrane accretion), flat-slab subduction, and rapid absolute upper plate motion overriding the downgoing plate. Accretionary orogens have been active throughout Earth history, extending back until at least 3.2 Ga, and potentially earlier, and provide an important constraint on the initiation of horizontal motion of lithospheric plates on Earth. They have been responsible for major growth of the continental lithosphere through the addition of juvenile magmatic products but are also major sites of consumption and reworking of continental crust through time, through sediment subduction and subduction erosion. It is probable that the rates of crustal growth and destruction are roughly equal, implying that net growth since the Archaean is effectively zero.},

The accuracy of these surface reconstructions is critical for quantitative structural analysis. Assessment of LiDAR and SfM methodologies suggest that SfM results are comparable to high data-density LiDAR on individual surfaces. The effect of chosen acquisition technique on the full outcrop and the efficacy on its virtual form for quantitative structural analysis and prediction beyond single bedding surfaces, however, is less certain. Here, we compare the accuracy of digital virtual outcrop analysis with traditional field data, for structural measurements and along-strike prediction of fold geometry from Stackpole syncline. In this case, the SfM virtual outcrop, derived from UAV imagery, yields better along-strike predictions and a more reliable geological model, in spite of lower accuracy surface reconstructions than LiDAR. This outcome is attributed to greater coverage by UAV and reliable reconstruction of a greater number of bedding planes than terrestrial LiDAR, which suffers from the effects of occlusion. Irrespective of the chosen acquisition technique, we find that workflows must incorporate careful survey planning, data processing and quality checking of derived data if virtual outcrops are to be used for robust structural analysis and along-strike prediction.},

 abstract = {Thermomechanical models of mantle lithosphere removal from beneath the southern Sierra Nevada region, California (USA), predict a complex spatiotemporal pattern of vertical surface displacements. We evaluate these models by using (U-Th)/He thermochronometry, together with other paleothermometry estimates, to investigate such topographic transients. We target Tertiary strata from the Kern arch, a crescent-shaped active uplift located in the southeastern San Joaquin Basin, along the western fl ank of the southern Sierra Nevada. Kern arch stratigraphy provides a unique record of subsidence and exhumation in a sensitive region immediately adjacent to the delaminating mantle lithosphere at depth. Detrital apatite (U-Th)/He ages from Oligocene-Miocene sandstones collected in Kern arch well cores indicate postdepositional heating to temperatures beyond those corresponding with their present burial depths. When integrated with available geologic and stratigraphic constraints, temperature-time modeling of thermo chronometric data suggests partial He loss from apatites at temperatures of 70-90°C, followed by exhumation to present burial temperatures of 35-60°C since ca. 6 Ma. By constraining the late Cenozoic geothermal gradient to ̃25°C/km, our results imply 1.0-1.6 km of rapid (̃0.4 mm/yr) subsidence and sedimentation, and then subsequent uplift and exhumation of southeastern San Joaquin Basin strata in latest Miocene-Quaternary time. Stratigraphic and geomorphic relations further constrain the principal burial episode to ca. 2.5 Ma or later, and exhumation to ca. 1 Ma or later. Subtle differences in the maximum temperatures achieved in various wells may refl ect differing degrees of tectonic subsidence and sedimentation as a function of growth faulting and distance from the range front. Our results are consistent with estimates of surface subsidence and uplift from Sierran delamination models, which predict a minimum of ̃0.7 km of tectonic subsidence in regions retaining mantle lithosphere adjacent to the area of delamination, and a minimum of ̃0.8 km of rock uplift in regions where delamination occurred recently. We attribute the marked pulse of tectonic subsidence in the San Joaquin Basin to viscous coupling between the lower crust and a downwelling mass in the delaminating slab. The ensuing episode of exhumation is interpreted to result from the northwestward peeling back of the slab and the associated replacement of dense lithosphere with buoyant asthenosphere that drove rapid rock and surface uplift. © 2014 Geological Society of America.},

The algorithm works by constructing low degree polynomial optimization problems, which are solved to their global optimum using a series of convex linear matrix inequality relaxations. The algorithm is fast, stable, robust and has time complexity independent of the number of views. We show extensive results on synthetic as well as real datasets to validate our algorithm.},

 abstract = {Widespread, several-kilometer-thick successions of layered deposits occur as mounds that partly fill the troughs or chasmata that compose the Valles Marineris on Mars. Like terrestrial subice volcanoes, the layered deposits occur in a volcano-tectonic setting within basins that may have held ponded water or ice. On the basis of their dimensions, morphologies, and associated catastrophic floods and other geologic events as shown in Viking and new Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) data sets, we suggest that the interior deposits are volcanic in origin and possibly generated by subice eruptions. A tuya origin for the mounds can explain the lack of external sediment, mound heights that can rival the plateau, local flat-topped mesas, morphologically distinct mounds of different ages, horizontal to steep dips, fine-grained materials, indications of rare volcanic vents and lava flows, and spectral composition. The extremely diverse layering of west Candor Chasma and possible volcanic cones in Melas may have formed by related subaerial eruptions. Consistent with the suggestion that interior deposits are eroding out of the wall rock, some deposits could have been erupted from sites along the walls.},

 abstract = {The San Emigdio and related Pelona, Orocopia, Rand and Sierra de Salinas schists of southern California were underplated beneath the southern Sierra Nevada batholith and adjacent southern California batholith along a shallow segment of the subducting Farallon plate in Late Cretaceous to early Tertiary time. These subduction accretion assemblages represent a regional, deeply exhumed, shallowly dipping domain from an ancient slab segmentation system and record the complete life cycle of the segmentation process from initial flattening and compression to final extensional collapse. An important unresolved question regarding shallow subduction zones concerns how the thermal structure evolves during the slab flattening process. New field relationships, thermobarometry, thermodynamic modelling and garnet diffusion modelling are presented that speak to this issue and elucidate the tectonics of underplating and exhumation of the San Emigdio Schist. We document an upsection increase in peak temperature (i.e. inverted metamorphism), from 590 to 700°C, peak pressures ranging from 8.5 to 11.1kbar, limited partial melting, microstructural evidence for large seismic events, rapid cooling (825-380°CMyr -1) from peak conditions and an 'out and back'P-T path. While inverted metamorphism is a characteristic feature of southern California schists, the presence of partial melt and high temperatures (650°C) are restricted to exposures with maximum depositional ages between 80 and 90Ma. Progressive cooling and tectonic underplating beneath an initially hot upper plate following the onset of shallow subduction provide a working hypothesis explaining high temperatures and partial melting in San Emigdio and Sierra de Salinas schists, inverted metamorphism in the schist as a whole, and the observed P-T trajectory calculated from the San Emigdio body. Lower temperatures in Pelona, Orocopia and Rand schists are likewise explained in the context of this overarching model. These results are consistent with an inferred tectonic evolution from shallow subduction beneath the then recently active Late Cretaceous arc to exhumation by rapid trench-directed channelized extrusion in the subducted schist. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

 abstract = {Magmatic arcs are the primary locations where continental crust is distilled to an intermediate, calc-alkaline composition. The root zones of continental arcs are thought to be the primary sites of magmatic differentiation, yet few deeply exhumed arc sections are available for direct study. The Coast Ridge Belt of central coastal California provides an exceptional opportunity to directly observe the cumulative effects of melting, mixing, assimilation, and homogenization related to construction of the Latest Cretaceous California arc. We present new major and trace element chemistry, as well as radiogenic isotopic ratios determined on Coast Ridge Belt assemblages representative of 20 to 30km crustal levels. Late Cretaceous (ca. 93 to 81Ma) gabbro, diorite, tonalite, and granodiorite of the Coast Ridge Belt are calc-alkaline, some exhibit cumulate characteristics, and all show enriched isotopic compositions (Sri=0.7061 to 0.7092 and ??Nd=+1.4 to -5.9). Rare earth element patterns in igneous and metaigneous rocks of the Coast Ridge Belt suggest that they are sourced deeper than the ̃25km paleodepth of the exposed section, but probably not significantly below 40km. Underplating of basaltic melts derived from evolved lithospheric mantle provides the most satisfactory mechanism explaining geochemical and field evidence for partial melting and assimilation of metasedimentary framework rocks to yield gabbroic to dioritic magmas, followed soon thereafter by remelting to produce more silicic magmas. We suggest that basaltic underplating provided a source of heat to the base of the Salinian crust, leading to thermal weakening and downward flow of melt-fertile intra-arc supracrustal assemblages, thereby igniting the magmatic pulse that formed the Salinian arc. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

 abstract = {The North China Craton (NCC) lost its Archean keels in the Phanerozoic. Prevalent and intensive magmatism, mineralization, and development of extensional basins in the late Mesozoic NCC imply that the late Mesozoic could be the key stage for this transformation. Ultramafic xenoliths in the Early Cretaceous high-Mg diorites of Shandong province might provide key information about the transformation of subcontinental lithospheric mantle (SCLM) beneath the NCC. Here we present a unique composite dunite-orthopyroxenite xenolith from Tietonggou, one of the high-Mg diorite-dominated plutons in Laiwu, Shandong province. The petrography and mineral chemistry of the xenolith suggest complicated metasomatic processes, which occurred before its entrainment in the host magma. Early stage metasomatism includes the growth of intergranular phlogopite and clinopyroxene and the development of a phlogopite- and amphibole-bearing clinopyroxenite veinlet. Late-stage metasomatism (termed Si (Na) metasomatism) is characterized by the growth of secondary orthopyroxene, Na-rich plagioclase and amphibole with resorption of olivine and clinopyroxene, and the decomposition of phlogopite. The xenolith has exceptionally high concentrations of Na2O and Al2O3 and shows enrichments in Cs, Rb, Th, U, K, and the light rare earth elements. It also shows positive Pb and Sr anomalies and negative Nb, Ta, P, and Ti anomalies in a primitive mantle normalized spider gram. The geochemistry, as well as the elevated delta(18)O, suggests that this Si (Na) metasomatism is associated with subduction. The secondary orthopyroxene in the orthopyroxenite portion of the xenolith has exceptionally low Mg\# values, which may be the result of reaction between silica-rich melts and olivine with high melt: rock ratios. Mg-Fe disequilibrium of the minerals in the orthopyroxenite indicates that Si (Na) metasomatism may have been introduced shortly before entrainment of the xenolith in the host magma. Correlation of the Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic compositions of ultramafic xenoliths, high-Mg diorites, and adakitic granites of the Tietonggou indicates there may be a genetic relationship between these rocks. Thus we propose that the SCLM beneath Shandong may have been metasomatized by a slab-derived melt. Since Si (Na) metasomatism occurred at the key stage of lithospheric thinning, oceanic subduction might have been involved in the thinning process.},

This is fuelled by difficulties in unravelling the exact processes involved in their formation. Here we provide fossil environmental evidence for anoxygenic photoferrotrophic deposition of analogue banded iron rocks in shallow marine waters associated with an Early Quaternary hydrothermal vent field on Milos Island, Greece. Trace metal, major and rare earth elemental compositions suggest that the deposited rocks closely resemble banded iron formations of Precambrian origin. Well-preserved microbial fossils in combination with chemical data imply that band formation was linked to periodic massive encrustation of anoxygenic phototrophic biofilms by iron oxyhydroxide alternating with abiotic silica precipitation. The data implicate cyclic anoxygenic photoferrotrophy and their fossilization mechanisms in the construction of microskeletal fabrics that result in the formation of characteristic banded iron formation bands of varying silica and iron oxide ratios.},

@article{Chin2015,
 abstract = {Abstract Most magmatism occurs at mid-ocean ridges, where plate divergence leads to decompression melting of the mantle, and at volcanic arcs, where subduction leads to volatile-assisted decompression melting in the hot mantle wedge. While plate spreading and subduction are continuous, arc magmatism, particularly in continental arcs, is characterised by 10-50 Myr intervals of enhanced magmatic activity followed by rapid decline (DeCelles et al.). In some cases, such as the Andes, this pattern has recurred several times (Haschke et al., 2002). Abrupt changes in plate convergence rates and direction (Pilger, 1984) or repeated steepening and shallowing of subducting slabs (Kay and Coira, 2009) have been suggested as triggering flare-ups or terminating magmatism, but such scenarios may not be sufficiently general. Here, we examine the thermal history of deep crustal and lithospheric xenoliths from the Cretaceous Sierra Nevada batholith, California (USA). The deepest samples (̃90 km), garnet-bearing spinel peridotites, show cooling-related exsolution of garnet from high-Al pyroxenes originally formed at 1275 °C. Modelling of pyroxene Al diffusion profiles requires rapid cooling from 1275 to 750 °C within ̃10 Myr. Also suggesting deep-seated, rapid cooling is a garnet websterite from ̃90 km depth with nearly identical Lu-Hf (92.6 ± 1.6 Ma) and Sm-Nd (88.8 ± 3.1 Ma) isochron ages to within error. Thermal modelling shows that this cooling history can be explained by impingement of the base of the Sierran lithosphere against a cold subducting slab at ̃90 km depth, precluding cooling by shallowing subduction. Rather, the coincidence of the radiometric ages with the magmatic flare-up (120-80 Ma) suggests that the hot mantle wedge above the subducting slab may have been pinched out by magmatic (± tectonic) thickening of the upper plate, eventually terminating mantle melting. Magmatic flare-ups in continental arcs are thus self-limiting, which explains why continental arc magmatism occurs in narrow time intervals. Convective removal of the deep arc lithosphere can initiate another magmatic cycle.},

Growth of the ice sheets to their maximum positions occurred between 33.0 and 26.5 ka in response to climate forcing from decreases in northern summer insolation, tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures, and atmospheric CO2. Nearly all ice sheets were at their LGM positions from 26.5 ka to 19 to 20 ka, corresponding to minima in these forcings. The onset of Northern Hemisphere deglaciation 19 to 20 ka was induced by an increase in northern summer insolation, providing the source for an abrupt rise in sea level. The onset of deglaciation of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet occurred between 14 and 15 ka, consistent with evidence that this was the primary source for an abrupt rise in sea level approximately 14.5 ka.},

 abstract = {Recent data collected in the Arctic have demonstrated the transport of atmospheric aerosol of anthropogenic origin into that region. Concern over the radiative effect of the highly-absorbing soot component of this aerosol has resulted in a variety of atmospheric sampling efforts aimed at assessing the climatic impact of this component. However, little attention has been given to the measurement of soot deposited on the Arctic snowpack and the resulting perturbation of snow albedo, snowmelt rates and radiative transfer. Here we report measurements of light-absorbing material in the Arctic snowpack for longitudes from 25 E to 160 W. The contributions to light absorption due to natural crustal and soot aerosol are identified by their wavelength dependence. Reductions in Arctic snow albedo of one to several percent appear probable for the soot/ice mass fractions obtained to date. Estimates of the impact of this reduced albedo on the Arctic radiation budget over a season are shown to approximately equal that of the Arctic haze itself. The absorption of shortwave radiation by the springtime snowpack is estimated to be 5-10\% higher than that of soot-free snow for this data. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

 abstract = {AbstractClenet et al. (2011) have developed an adapted version of the Modified Gaussian Model (MGM). The improvements allow the characterization of spectra of olivine?pyroxene(s) mixtures, addressing both modal composition and individual minerals chemical composition. This version of MGM is fully automated and operational with large amounts of hyperspectral imaging data. Two natural cases are considered. The first one is the Sumail massif in the Oman ophiolite (Earth). Based on our approach applied to HyMap data, two contrasted lithologic units are mapped: the mantle, which is harzburgite dominated, and the crust made of gabbros and clinopyroxene?rich cumulates, with spectral variations interpreted in terms of pyroxenes chemical compositions. Once this new MGM mapping approach has been validated on a controlled natural situation, we map the distribution of mafic assemblages across the Syrtis Major volcano on Mars using a visible and near?infrared (VNIR) ? short wave infrared (SWIR) Observatoire pour la minéralogie, l'eau, les glaces et l'activité (OMEGA) / Mars Express (MEx) mosaic. Our results are in agreement with previous work but olivine appears to be more abundant than previously estimated in the central part of the volcanic edifice, especially in ternary mafic assemblages (augite, olivine, enstatite). Based on these results, we propose a possible scenario for the igneous (and thus thermal) evolution of the Syrtis Major region. Surrounding terrains have formed first and local heterogeneity can be observed between northern and southern areas of the Noachian crust. We also observe variations in the mineral assemblages within Syrtis Major lavas, which can be interpreted in terms of differentiation from a common parent melt and/or of a progressive evolution of the mantle source composition and temperature.},

 abstract = {New U-Pb geochronologic data indicate that the Tuolumne Intrusive Suite, California, was assembled over a period of at least 10 m.y. between 95 and 85 Ma, and that the Half Dome Granodiorite intruded over a period approaching 4 m.y. Simple thermal considerations preclude the possibility that a magma chamber the size of the Half Dome pluton could have existed as a liquid at shallow crustal depths for that long. Rather, field evidence for sheeting along the margins of the suite, the range of ages, and the regular decrease of ages toward the center of the suite and within individual plutons suggest incremental assembly. Geochronologic evidence for incremental assembly is consistent with the failure of geophysical methods to detect large magma chambers with more than [̃]20\% melt, even in active volcanic areas. Because it is unlikely that the individual plutons composing the Tuolumne ever coexisted as liquid-rich magmas, the chemical evolution of the suite cannot be the result of simple fractionation and/or mixing between exposed units, but instead must reflect processes occurring during magma generation.},

@incollection{Crater2012,
 abstract = {The Mars Exploration Rover has investigated bedrock outcrops exposed in several craters at Meridiani Planum, Mars, in an effort to better understand the role of surface processes in its geologic history. has recently completed its observations of Victoria crater, which is 750 m in diameter and exposes cliffs up to ∼15 m high. The plains surrounding Victoria crater are ∼10 m higher in elevation than those surrounding the previously explored Endurance crater, indicating that the Victoria crater exposes a stratigraphically higher section than does the Endurance crater; however, Victoria strata overlap in elevation with the rocks exposed at the Erebus crater. Victoria crater has a well-developed geomorphic pattern of promontories and embayments that define the crater wall and that reveal thick bedsets (3–7 m) of large-scale cross-bedding, interpreted as fossil eolian dunes. Opportunity was able to drive into the crater at Duck Bay, located on the western margin of Victoria crater. Data from the Microscopic Imager and Panoramic Camera reveal details about the structures, textures, and depositional and diagenetic events that influenced the Victoria bedrock. A lithostratigraphic subdivision of bedrock units was enabled by the presence of a light-toned band that lines much of the upper rim of the crater. In ascending order, three stratigraphic units are named Lyell, Smith, and Steno; Smith is the light-toned band. In the Reference Section exposed along the ingress path at Duck Bay, Smith is interpreted to represent a zone of diagenetic recrystallization; however, its upper contact also coincides with a primary erosional surface. Elsewhere in the crater the diagenetic band crosscuts the physical stratigraphy. Correlation with strata present at nearby promontory Cape Verde indicates that there is an erosional surface at the base of the cliff face that corresponds to the erosional contact below Steno. The erosional contact at the base of Cape Verde lies at a lower elevation, but within the same plane as the contact below Steno, which indicates that the material above the erosional contact was built on significant depositional paleotopography. The eolian dune forms exposed in Duck Bay and Cape Verde, combined with the geometry of the erosional surface, indicate that these outcrops may be part of a larger-scale draa architecture. This insight is possible only as a result of the larger-scale exposures at Victoria crater, which significantly exceed the more limited exposures at the Erebus, Endurance, and Eagle craters.},

 abstract = {This paper shows for the first time that is possible to re- construct the position of rigid objects and to jointly recover affine camera calibration solely from a set of object detec- tions in a video sequence. In practice, this work can be con- sidered as the extension of Tomasi and Kanade factorization method using objects. Instead of using points to form a rank constrained measurement matrix, we can form a matrix with similar rank properties using 2D object detection proposals. In detail, we first fit an ellipse onto the image plane at each bounding box as given by the object detector. The collection of all the ellipses in the dual space is used to create a mea- surement matrix that gives a specific rank constraint. This matrix can be factorised and metrically upgraded in order to provide the affine camera matrices and the 3D position of the objects as an ellipsoid. Moreover, we recover the full 3D quadric thus giving additional information about object oc- cupancy and 3D pose. Finally, we also show that 2D points measurements can be seamlessly included in the framework to reduce the number of objects required. This last aspect unifies the classical point-based Tomasi and Kanade ap- proach with objects in a unique framework. Experiments with synthetic and real data show the feasibility of our ap- proach for the affine camera case. 1.},

@article{Crow2011,
 abstract = {Geochronologic data from the southern margins of the Colorado Plateau (western United States) show an inboard radial migration of Neogene basaltic magmatism. Nd and Sr isotopic data show that as basaltic volcanism migrates inboard it also becomes increasingly more asthenospheric. Strongly asthenospheric alkali basalt (epsilon(Nd)  4) appeared on the western plateau margin ca. 5 Ma, on the southeastern margin at 7 Ma, and is lacking from the plateau's other margins. Tomographic data suggest that low-velocity mantle underlies almost all recent (younger than 1 Ma) basaltic volcanism in a ring around much of the Colorado Plateau at a depth of 80 km. The combined isotopic and tomographic data indicate that the low-velocity mantle is asthenosphere along the western and southeastern margins of the plateau, but modified lithosphere around the remaining margins. Temporal and spatial patterns suggest a process by which upwelling asthenosphere is progressively infiltrating and replacing lithospheric mantle, especially where Proterozoic boundaries exist. This model explains (1) the dramatic velocity contrast seen well inboard of the physiographic edge of the plateau, (2) the inboard sweep of Neogene magmatism, and (3) isotopic evidence that much (but not all) of the low-velocity mantle is asthenospheric. These data support models that ongoing uplift of the edges of the Colorado Plateau is driven by mantle processes.},

@article{Davies2011,
 abstract = {The Palaeozoic greening of the continents – the appearance and expansion of embryophytes (land plants) in terrestrial environments – was arguably the most fundamental Phanerozoic change to the Earth system. Thirteen case studies of Cambrian to Devonian fluvial deposits from North America and Europe are documented here to illustrate the evolution of fluvial style during this period. During the Cambro-Ordovician, prior to the advent of terrestrial vegetation, fluvial systems laid down relatively coarse sands with little mud, resulting in self-formed channels and an architecture dominated by broad sheets of trough cross-beds (sheet-braided style). Similar deposits formed across a wide range of latitudes, and passed basinward into sandy coastal deposits. From the mid Ordovician onwards, an increase in floodplain mudstone corresponds broadly with the appearance of embryophytes, which would have progressively enhanced upland weathering, mud production and floodplain storage of fines. During the Late Silurian, small heterolithic channel bodies with lateral-accretion sets provide the first evidence of meandering channels, and floodplain mudstones contain more varied palaeosols, especially calcretes which appear abundantly for the first time. By the Early Devonian, channel deposits comprise sandstone lenses (channelled-braided style), probably due to the increased bank strength and cohesion and reduced potential for sediment sorting imparted by sand-mud mixtures. Muddy coastal deposits are prominent. By the Upper Devonian, fluvial deposits commonly contain fossil trees and large mainstem meandering channels with lateral- accretion sets, indicating that rooted vegetation stabilized channels. The advent of stable floodplains with leve ´es, crevasse splays and organic litter would have encouraged the diversification of terrestrial invertebrates, which left alluvial ichnological signatures from the Late Silurian onwards.},

@article{DeCelles2004,
 abstract = {Geochronological, structural, and sedimentological data provide the basis for a regional synthesis of the evolution of the Cordilleran retroarc thrust belt and foreland basin system in the western U.S.A. In this region, the Cordilleran orogenic belt became tectonically consolidated during Late Jurassic time (similar to155 Ma) with the closure of marginal oceanic basins and accretion of fringing arcs along the western edge of the North American plate. Over the ensuing 100 Myr, contractile deformation propagated approximately 1000 kilometers eastward, culminating in the formation of the Laramide Rocky Mountain ranges. At the peak of its development, the retroarc side of the Cordillera was divided into five tectonomorphic zones, including from west to east the Luning-Fencemaker thrust belt; the central Nevada (or Eureka) thrust belt; a high-elevation plateau (the "Nevadaplano"); the topographically rugged Sevier fold-thrust belt; and the Laramide zone of intraforeland basement uplifts and basins. Mid-crustal rocks beneath the Nevadaplano experienced high-grade metamorphism and shortening during Late Jurassic and mid- to Late Cretaceous time, and the locus of major, upper crustal thrust faulting migrated sporadically eastward. By Late Cretaceous time, the middle crust beneath the Nevadaplano was experiencing decompression and cooling, perhaps in response to large-magnitude ductile extension and isostatic exhumation, concurrent with ongoing thrusting in the frontal Sevier belt. The tectonic history of the Sevier belt was remarkably consistent along strike of the orogenic belt, with emplacement of regional-scale Proterozoic and Paleozoic megathrust sheets during Early Cretaceous time and multiple, more closely spaced, Paleozoic and Mesozoic thrust sheets during Late Cretaceous-Paleocene time. Coeval with emplacement of the frontal thrust sheets, large structural culminations in Archean-Proterozoic crystalline basement developed along the basement step formed by Neoproterozoic rifting. A complex foreland basin system evolved in concert with the orogenic wedge. During its early and late history (similar to155-110 Ma and similar to70-55 Ma) the basin was dominated by nonmarine deposition, whereas marine waters inundated the basin during its midlife (similar to110-70 Ma). Late Jurassic basin development was controlled by both flexural and dynamic subsidence. From Early Cretaceous through early Late Cretaceous time the basin was dominated by flexural subsidence. From Late Cretaceous to mid-Cenozoic time the basin was increasingly partitioned by basement-involved Laramide structures. Linkages between Late Jurassic and Late Cretaceous Cordilleran arcmagmatism and westward underthrusting of North American continental lithosphere beneath the arc are not plainly demonstrable from the geological record in the Cordilleran thrust belt. A significant lag-time (similar to20 Myr) between shortening and coeval underthrusting, on the one hand, and generation of arc melts, on the other, is required for any linkage to exist. However, inferred Late Jurassic lithospheric delamination may have provided a necessary precondition to allow relatively rapid Early Cretaceous continental underthrusting, which in turn could have catalyzed the Late Cretaceous arc flare-up.},

 abstract = {Classifications which attempt to combine descriptive and genetic aspects of types of drainage basins must take into account the application of new techniques (satellite imagery, high-precision topographic maps and digital terrain models). In addition, the use of new concepts such as neotectonics and drainage basin history will lead to a reassessment of classification schemes. After a review of current classifications, we propose a genetic scheme that is based on the development of drainage networks and which includes integration of local and regional-scale perturbations. State-of-the-art methods of drainage basin analysis are applied to the Zaire Basin to provide new information on deep structures. The influence of basin and block tectonics is revealed in the context of major Late Proterozoic shear faults which have been rejuvenated up to the present day. This is demonstrated from an analysis of the drainage network in the light of geological and geophysical observations.},

@article{Dehler2001,
 abstract = {Chuar Group sediments were deposited in a marine cratonic basin synchronously with marine deposition in other basins of western North America and Australia. The top of the Chuar Group is 742 Ma; thus, this succession offers a potentially important record of global climatic and tectonic changes during the mid-Neoproterozoic - A critical time leading to possible global glaciation during supercontinent rifting. Chuar Group cycles and sequences may record glacioeustatic fluctuations during the climatic transition into the Sturtian Ice Age (̃750-700 Ma), as well as extension related to the dispersal of Rodinia. The mid-Neoproterozoic Chuar Group (1600 m thick) is predominantly composed of mudrock with subordinate meter-scale beds of dolomite and sandstone. Facies analysis leads to the interpretation of a wave- and tidal-influenced marine depositional system. Diagnostic marine features include: (1) Marine fossils and high local pyrite content in the mudrock facies; (2) mudcracked mud-draped symmetric ripples and reverse flow indicators in The sandstone facies; (3) Facies associations between all facies; and (4) No unequivocal terrestrial deposits. Chuar facies stack into ̃320 dolomite- and sandstone-capped meter-scale cycles (1-20 m thick) and non-cyclic intervals of uniform mudrock facies (20-150 m thick). Nearly all cycles have mudrock bases indicating subtidal water depths. Dolomite-capped cycles shallow to peritidal environments (peritidal cycles), some indicating subaerial exposure of varying degrees (exposure cycles). Sandstone-capped cycles shallow to peritidal environments with no evidence of prolonged exposure (peritidal cycles). Non-cyclic intervals represent the deepest water depths (̃10s of meters). Peritidal cycles and non-cyclic intervals dominate the lower and middle Chuar Group. In the upper Chuar Group, the percentage of exposure cycles increases, as does the thickness of individual cycles and non-cyclic intervals, and the degree of subaerial exposure in the cycle caps. Correlation of cycles across 10 km shows that many cycles are laterally continuous and some vary in thickness. Some thickness changes are coincident with local and regional extensional structures. These cycle trends reflect a resolvable mixture of tectonic and climatic controls. Cycles are interpreted to be high frequency and glacioeustatically-controlled based on comparison of cycle character and thickness to Phanerozoic examples, and lateral continuity of many cycles, respectively. Cycles in the lower and middle Chuar Group show characteristics suggestive of low-amplitude sea-level changes similar to meter-scale cycles from global greenhouse climates in the Phanerozoic. Upper Chuar Group cycles show characteristics suggestive of moderate-amplitude sea-level changes similar to Phanerozoic greenhouse-icehouse transition climates, indicating an increase in continental ice volume. Variability in cycle thickness and lateral pinching of some cycle caps is controlled by variable tectonic subsidence, evidenced by thickening trends coincident with active rift-related structures, and also by variability in sediment supply. The presence of dolomite caps, in this otherwise siliciclastic succession, is interpreted to be due largely to rapid changes in climate related to short-term glacioeustatically-controlled sea-level changes. Four crude lithostratigraphic sequences (150-775 m thick) are defined based on dolomite-poor to dolomite-rich stratigraphic intervals. Long-term changes in cycle cap-lithology may be driven by long-term changes in climate, similar to short-term glacioeustatic controls on meter-scale cycle cap lithology. Large-scale thickness variability in these sequences is due to local differential tectonic subsidence. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

 abstract = {The climate of early Mars could have supported a complex hydrological system and possibly a northern hemispheric ocean covering up to one-third of the planet's surface1, 2, 3, 4, 5. This notion has been repeatedly proposed1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and challenged6, 7 over the past two decades, and remains one of the largest uncertainties in Mars research. Here, we used global databases of known deltaic deposits, valley networks8 and present-day martian topography to test for the occurrence of an ocean on early Mars. The distribution of ancient martian deltas delineates a planet-wide equipotential surface within and along the margins of the northern lowlands. We suggest that the level reconstructed from the analysis of the deltaic deposits may represent the contact of a vast ocean covering the northern hemisphere of Mars around 3.5 billion years ago. This boundary is broadly consistent with palaeoshorelines suggested by previous geomorphologic, thermophysic and topographic analyses, and with the global distribution and age of ancient valley networks. Our findings lend credence to the hypothesis that an ocean formed on early Mars as part of a global and active hydrosphere.},

 abstract = {Ooid formation remains elusive despite their importance as palaeoclimatic indicators and important contributors to global carbonate budget. Based on stable isotopes, nutrient and elemental analyses on solid components and ooidal leachates, this study supports the notion of microbial involvement in the development of ooids from Great Bahama Bank. Carbon and nitrogen isotopic analyses on organic fractions identified geochemical signatures of microbial activity. The δ13C values for organic carbon in the bulk (−11˙9 to −16˙9‰); intercrystalline/intracrystalline (−11˙9 to 16˙7‰); and intracrystalline phases (−12˙4 to −17˙7‰) were similar and, except for the more enriched values of ooids from Butterfly Beach, were within the range of photosynthesisers. The δ15N values for the bulk (+0˙5 to −0˙2‰); intercrystalline/intracrystalline (−0˙3‰ to −0˙7‰) and intracrystalline organic matter (−0˙3 to −1˙7‰) showed a narrow range consistent with nitrogen fixation. While positive δ15N and δ18O values of the NO3− leached from the ooids provided evidence of denitrification, the carbonate associated sulphate δ34SCAS of the bulk sediments (+19˙2 to +19˙6‰) and δ34S of the leachates (+16˙6 to +18˙3‰) provided weak indication of sulphate reduction, suggesting either that high concentrations of isotopically enriched S are overriding bio-signatures of sulphate reduction or that microbes are preferentially using NO3− as an electron acceptor. In contrast, the elevated sulphate concentrations of the leachates suggest the occurrence of microbial sulphide oxidation within ooids. The high Mg/Ca of the leachates and scanning electron microscope analyses provide putative evidence of amorphous calcium carbonate and a formative role in CaCO3 precipitation. Together, these findings indicate that a redox dependent microbial consortium may influence CaCO3 precipitation in the form of ooid accretion, cementation and micritization. It is also inferred that ooid deposits are not suitable indicators of palaeoclimate because ooids are affected throughout their life by a complex chain of abiotic and biological processes which can lead to large geochemical offsets.},

To date, most orbital observations that attest to past fluvial and lacustrine activity on Mars have been dedicated to surficial landforms (i.e., drainage networks and depositional fans). Here we report an unprecedented identification of typical stratigraphic architectures made in Mars Global Surveyor Mars Orbiter Camera images of layered material in southern Melas Chasma. A particular set of strata is arranged in three depositional sequences bounded by stratigraphic unconformities. The sequences show spectacular steeply inclined clinoforms, and a broad channel-like depression. There are the same complex stratal patterns in Valles Marineris on Mars as there are in terrestrial deposits. Insights into these three dimensional deposit geometries are used to tentatively isolate specific depositional processes and point to ancient subaqueous settings. Findings in southern Melas indicate a very attractive spot to which the search for ancient habitable environments on Mars could be directed.},

 abstract = {Surface exposures as well as deep-crustal and upper-mantle xenoliths constrain the composition of the lithospheric column beneath the Sierra Nevada mountain range (California) as it resulted from the generation of the Mesozoic Sierra Nevada batholith (SNB). After the cessation of magmatism at ∼80 Ma, the SNB consisted of a ∼30 to 35 km thick granitic crust underlain by a batholithic “root,” a ∼70 km thick sequence of mafic-ultramafic, mainly eclogite-facies cumulate and residues. The deeper root assemblages consist largely of garnet and pyroxenes that precipitated as igneous cumulate phases during the SNB magmatism. The root assemblages were present beneath the SNB as recently as ∼8 to 12 Ma, when they were sampled as xenoliths in fast-ascending magmas erupted through the batholith. Several lines of evidence suggest that the eclogitic root may have disapeared from beneath the SNB since Miocene time, leading to a major change in the lithospheric column. There are no garnet-bearing xenoliths in the Pliocene...},

 abstract = {Apatite (U-Th)/He ages from a vertical transect through the Santa Lucia Mountains, central California Coast Ranges, are used to reconstruct the history of exhumation and of bedrock and surface uplift in this region since ca. 6 Ma. We find a direct correlation between (U-Th)/He ages and elevation, which we interpret to correspond to denudation rates of approximately 0.35 mm/yr between 6 and 2 Ma. The onset of bedrock uplift and exhumation ca. 6 Ma followed a change in plate motion ca. 8 Ma. After 2 Ma, denudation rates increased substantially ( approximately 0.9 mm/yr). This is a rare instance in which long-term average bedrock ( approximately 0.85 mm/yr) and surface ( approximately 0.20 mm/yr) uplift can be calculated from denudation rates and stratigraphic data. The post-2 Ma denudation rate is about one order of magnitude higher than independently determined river erosion rates in the area. We suggest that this discrepancy indicates that exhumation of the steep western slopes of this segment of the Coast Ranges has been dominated by mass wasting via landslides, rather than fluvial erosion, at least since ca. 2 Ma. We also show that the bedrock uplift is predominantly tectonic, not isostatic.},

 abstract = {Continental magmatic arcs form above subduction zones where the upper plate is continental lithosphere and/or accreted transitional lithosphere. The best-studied examples are found along the western margin of the Americas. They are Earth's largest sites of intermediate magmatism. They are long lived (tens to hundreds of millions of years) and spatially complex; their location migrates laterally due to a host of tectonic causes. Episodes of crustal and lithospheric thickening alternating with periods of root foundering produce cyclic vertical changes in arcs. The average plutonic and volcanic rocks in these arcs straddle the compositional boundary between an andesite and a dacite, very similar to that of continental crust; about half of that comes from newly added mafic material from the mantle. Arc products of the upper crust differentiated from deep crustal (40 km) residual materials, which are unstable in the lithosphere. Continental arcs evolve into stable continental masses over time; trace elemental budgets, however, present challenges to the concept that Phanerozoic arcs are the main factories of continental crust.},

 abstract = {Some locations on Mars are known to have water ice just below the surface, but how much has remained unclear. Dundas et al. used data from two orbiting spacecraft to examine eight locations where erosion has occurred. This revealed cliffs composed mostly of water ice, which is slowly sublimating as it is exposed to the atmosphere. The ice sheets extend from just below the surface to a depth of 100 meters or more and appear to contain distinct layers, which could preserve a record of Mars' past climate. They might even be a useful source of water for future human exploration of the red planet.

 abstract = {Microbial mats are ecosystems that arguably greatly affected the conditions of the biosphere on Earth through geological time. These laminated organosedimentary systems, which date back to  3.4??Ga bp, are characterized by high metabolic rates, and coupled to this, rapid cycling of major elements on very small (mm-??m) scales. The activity of the mat communities has changed Earth's redox conditions (i.e. oxidation state) through oxygen and hydrogen production. Interpretation of fossil microbial mats and their potential role in alteration of the Earth's geochemical environment is challenging because these mats are generally not well preserved. Preservation of microbial mats in the fossil record can be enhanced through carbonate precipitation, resulting in the formation of lithified mats, or microbialites. Several types of microbially-mediated mineralization can be distinguished, including biologically-induced and biologically influenced mineralization. Biologically-induced mineralization results from the interaction between biological activity and the environment. Biologically-influenced mineralization is defined as passive mineralization of organic matter (biogenic or abiogenic in origin), whose properties influence crystal morphology and composition. We propose to use the term organomineralization sensu lato as an umbrella term encompassing biologically influenced and biologically induced mineralization. Key components of organomineralization sensu lato are the "alkalinity" engine (microbial metabolism and environmental conditions impacting the calcium carbonate saturation index) and an organic matrix comprised of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), which may provide a template for carbonate nucleation. Here we review the specific role of microbes and the EPS matrix in various mineralization processes and discuss examples of modern aquatic (freshwater, marine and hypersaline) and terrestrial microbialites. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

 abstract = {Forty one airborne magnetic surveys flown between 1\%2 and 1992 over different areas of Namibia, with a total of about 700,000 km, have been compiled as part of a German-Namibian cooperation project to produce a refined compatible countrywide magnetic data set. It was required to compile the data as if the whole country was flown by a single survey at 100 m terrain clearance at the same magnetic epoch. Emphasis was therefore given to the selection of the magnetic reference field model. The creation of a digital terrain model (DTM) was compulsory. LeveIIingof the survey blocks was impeded since adjacent blocks were only rarely overlapping. The magnetic data set is available as both coloured contour maps (scales 1250 000 and 13 000 000) and digital grids with varying cell sires (2000 m, 500 m and 200 m). Shield areas, fold belts and anorogenic intrusions dominate the magnetic anomaly pattern of Namibia. The fold belts are characterized by parallel running, narrow (400 km) magnetic and vi\&tally non-magnetic zones. shield areas, covered by a thick sequence of mostly non-magnetic sediments, are distinguishedby broad, mid-amphtude anomalies with low gradients. The analysis of magnetic Iinearfeatures reveals the existence of two directional sets of magnetic lineationsrunning across both fold beltsand shieldareas.},

 abstract = {The Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity has investigated bedrock outcrops exposed in several craters at Meridiani Planum, Mars, in an effort to better understand the role of surface processes in its geologic history. Opportunity has recently completed its observations of Victoria crater, which is 750 m in diameter and exposes cliffs up to ;15 m high. The plains surrounding Victoria crater are ;10 m higher in elevation than those surrounding the previously explored Endurance crater, indicating that the Victoria crater exposes a stratigraphically higher section than does the Endurance crater; however, Victoria strata overlap in elevation with the rocks exposed at the Erebus crater. Victoria crater has a well-developed geomorphic pattern of promontories and embayments that deﬁne the crater wall and that reveal thick bedsets (3–7 m) of large-scale cross-bedding, interpreted as fossil eolian dunes. Opportunity was able to drive into the crater at Duck Bay, located on the western margin of Victoria crater. Data from the Microscopic Imager and Panoramic Camera reveal details about the structures, textures, and depositional and diagenetic events that inﬂuenced the Victoria bedrock. A lithostratigraphic subdivision of bedrock units was enabled by the presence of a light-toned band that lines much of the upper rim of the crater. In ascending order, three stratigraphic units are named Lyell, Smith, and Steno; Smith is the light-toned band. In the Reference Section exposed along the ingress path at Duck Bay, Smith is interpreted to represent a zone of diagenetic recrystallization; however, its upper contact also coincides with a primary erosional surface. Elsewhere in the crater the diagenetic band crosscuts the physical stratigraphy. Correlation with strata present at nearby promontory Cape Verde indicates that there is an erosional surface at the base of the cliff face that corresponds to the erosional contact below Steno. The erosional contact at the base of Cape Verde lies at a lower elevation, but within the same plane as the contact below Steno, which indicates that the material above the erosional contact was built on signiﬁcant depositional paleotopography. The eolian dune forms exposed in Duck Bay and Cape Verde, combined with the geometry of the erosional surface, indicate that these outcrops may be part of a larger-scale draa architecture. This insight is possible only as a result of the larger-scale exposures at Victoria crater, which signiﬁcantly exceed the more limited exposures at the Erebus, Endurance, and Eagle craters.},

 abstract = {The Noachian terrain west of the Isidis basin hosts a diverse collection of alteration minerals in rocks comprising varied geomorphic units within a 100,000 km2 region in and near the Nili Fossae. Prior investigations in this region by the Observatoire pour l'Minéralogie, l'Eau, les Glaces, et l'Activité (OMEGA) instrument on Mars Express revealed large exposures of both mafic minerals and iron magnesium phyllosilicates in stratigraphic context. Expanding on the discoveries of OMEGA, the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM) aboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) has found more spatially widespread and mineralogically diverse alteration minerals than previously realized, which represent multiple aqueous environments. Using CRISM near-infrared spectral data, we detail the basis for identification of iron and magnesium smectites (including both nontronite and more Mg-rich varieties), chlorite, prehnite, serpentine, kaolinite, potassium mica (illite or muscovite), hydrated (opaline) silica, the sodium zeolite analcime, and magnesium carbonate. The detection of serpentine and analcime on Mars is reported here for the first time. We detail the geomorphic context of these minerals using data from high-resolution imagers onboard MRO in conjunction with CRISM. We find that the distribution of alteration minerals is not homogeneous; rather, they occur in provinces with distinctive assemblages of alteration minerals. Key findings are (1) a distinctive stratigraphy, in and around the Nili Fossae, of kaolinite and magnesium carbonate in bedrock units always overlying Fe/Mg smectites and (2) evidence for mineral phases and assemblages indicative of low-grade metamorphic or hydrothermal aqueous alteration in cratered terrains. The alteration minerals around the Nili Fossae are more typical of those resulting from neutral to alkaline conditions rather than acidic conditions, which appear to have dominated much of Mars. Moreover, the mineralogic diversity and geologic context of alteration minerals found in the region around the Nili Fossae indicates several episodes of aqueous activity in multiple distinct environments.},

Analysis of how they formed should indicate what environmental conditions prevailed on early Mars. If clays formed near the surface by weathering, as is common on Earth, their presence would indicate past surface conditions warmer and wetter than at present. However, available data instead indicate substantial Martian clay formation by hydrothermal groundwater circulation and a Noachian rock record dominated by evidence of subsurface waters. Cold, arid conditions with only transient surface water may have characterized Mars's surface for over 4 billion years, since the early-Noachian period, and the longest-duration aqueous, potentially habitable environments may have been in the subsurface.},

 abstract = {The enhanced spatial and spectral resolution provided by the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM) on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) has led to the discovery of numerous hydrated silicate minerals on Mars, particularly in the ancient, cratered crust comprising the southern highlands. Phases recently identified using visible/near-infrared spectra include: smectite, chlorite, prehnite, high-charge phyllosilicates (illite or muscovite), the zeolite analcime, opaline silica, and serpentine. Some mineral assemblages represent the products of aqueous alteration at elevated temperatures. Geologic occurrences of these mineral assemblages are described using examples from west of the Isidis basin near the Nili Fossae and with reference to differences in implied temperature, fluid composition, and starting materials during alteration. The alteration minerals are not distributed homogeneously. Rather, certain craters host distinctive alteration assemblages: (1) prehnite-chloritesilica, (2) analcime-silica-Fe,Mg-smectite-chlorite, (3) chlorite-illite (muscovite), and (4) serpentine, which furthermore has been found in bedrock units. These assemblages contrast with the prevalence of solely Fe,Mg-smectites in most phyllosilicate-bearing terrains on Mars, and they represent materials altered at depth then exposed by cratering. Of the minerals found to date, prehnite provides the clearest evidence for subsurface, hydrothermal/metamorphic alteration, as it forms only under highly restricted conditions (T = 200À400ºC). Multiple mechanisms exist for forming the other individual minerals; however, the most likely formation mechanisms for the characteristic mineralogic assemblages observed are, for (1) and (2), lowgrade metamorphism or hydrothermal ($<$400ºC) circulation of fluids in basalt; for (3), transformation of trioctahedral smectites to chlorite and dioctahedral smectites to illite during diagenesis; and for (4), lowgrade metamorphism or hydrothermal ($<$400ºC) circulation of fluids in ultramafic rocks. Evidence for highgrade metamorphism at elevated pressures or temperatures $>$400ºC has not been found.},

 abstract = {The past fifteen years of orbital infrared spectroscopy and in situ exploration have led to a new understanding of the composition and history of Mars. Globally, Mars has a basaltic upper crust with regionally variable quanti-ties of plagioclase, pyroxene, and olivine associated with distinctive terrains. Enrichments in olivine (20\%) are found around the largest basins and within late Noachian–early Hesperian lavas. Alkali volcanics are also locally present, pointing to regional differences in igneous processes. Many ma-terials from ancient Mars bear the mineralogic fingerprints of interaction with water. Clay minerals, found in exposures of Noachian crust across the globe, preserve widespread evidence for early weathering, hydrothermal, and diagenetic aqueous environments. Noachian and Hesperian sediments include paleolake deposits with clays, carbonates, sulfates, and chlorides that are more localized in extent. The late Hesperian to Amazonian mineralogic record of water is sparser, though sulfates and silica in some locations indi-cate local availability of ground and surface waters even in the most recent geologic epoch.},

 abstract = {Carbonate clumped isotope thermometry is a relatively new paleotemperature proxy based on measurements of the degree of ordering of 13C and 18O into bonds with each other (making the 13C18O16O2 -2 ion group) in lattices of carbonate minerals. This technique has several unusual properties that complement existing methods of paleoclimate reconstruction. Most importantly, it is based on a homogeneous isotope exchange equilibrium and thus constrains temperature independent of the isotopic composition of waters from which carbonates grew. This method also appears to be generally insensitive to 'vital effects' that compromise many other paleothermometers based on the chemical properties of biominerals or organic matter, at least for those organisms that have been subjected to systematic study to-date (corals and foraminifera); however, discrepancies among some calibrations, particularly at low temperatures, may point toward the existence of vital effects in mollusks and other organisms. This review discusses the principles and calibrations of the technique, its uses in combination with conventional stable isotope measurements to constrain the ??18O of past waters, preservation of paleotemperatures in ancient materials, as well as current problems in our understanding of calibrations and interlaboratory data comparisons. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

 abstract = {Two of the most widely studied landforms that are associated with a putative ocean that filled the northern hemisphere of Mars are (1) the Vastitas Borealis Formation (VBF), plain units that cover a larger portion of the northern lowlands of Mars, and (2) a candidate paleoshoreline, e.g., the Deuteronilus contact, which represents the outer margin of the VBF. The VBF and the Deuteronilus contact are interpreted to result from a short-lived Late Hesperian ocean that readily froze and sublimated. Similar landforms are also present in the impact basin of Isidis Planitia and suggest formation processes comparable to those that formed the VBF and the Deuteronilus contact in the northern lowlands. Our study of the Deuteronilus contact in Isidis revealed geologic evidence that possibly supports the existence of a Late Hesperian/Early Amazonian Isidis Sea. For example, numerous valleys that are incised into the plains of the southern Isidis basin rim between 82°/90°E and 3°/6°N and trend a few tens of kilometers to the north following the general topographic gradient toward the center of Isidis Planitia. A few of them reach the Deuteronilus contact and continue as sinuous ridges in the Isidis Interior Plains (IIP).Based on our findings we conclude that the geologic setting along the Deuteronilus contact, including the valleys and ridges is a result of (1) Late Hesperian short-term fluvial activity, (2) a Late Hesperian/Early Amazonian short-lived Isidis Sea that readily froze, (3) subglacial drainage and esker formation, and (4) subsequent sublimation of the proposed Isidis ice sheet. Although the fluvio-glacial model we introduce in our manuscript cannot fully explain the geologic setting, possible alternative formation models, including relief inversion and fluvio-volcanic scenarios are even less capable in explaining the observed geologic setting along the Deuteronilus contact.},

 abstract = {We report a new 153 ± 2 Ma SIMS U-Pb date for zircons from the hypabyssal Guadalupe pluton which crosscuts and contact metamorphoses upper crustal Mariposa slates in the southern Sierra. A ∼950 m thick section of dark metashales lies below sandstones from which clastic zircons were analyzed at 152 ± 2 Ma. Assuming a compacted depositional rate of ∼120 m/Myr, accumulation of Mariposa volcanogenic sediments, which overlie previously stranded Middle Jurassic and older ophiolite + chert-argillite belts in the Sierran Foothills, began no later than ∼160 Ma. Correlative Oxfordian-Kimmeridgian strata of the Galice Formation occupy a similar position in the Klamath Mountains. We speculate that the Late Jurassic was a time of transition from (1) a mid-Paleozoic–Middle Jurassic interval of mainly but not exclusively strike-slip and episodic docking of oceanic terranes; (2) to transpressive plate underflow, producing calcalkaline igneous arc rocks ± outboard blueschists at ∼170–150 Ma, whose erosion promoted accumulation of the Mariposa-Galice overlap strata; (3) continued transpressive underflow attending ∼200 km left-lateral displacement of the Klamath salient relative to the Sierran arc at ∼150–140 Ma and development of the apparent polar wander path cusps for North and South America; and (4) then nearly orthogonal mid and Late Cretaceous convergence commencing at ∼125–120 Ma, during reversal in tangential motion of the Pacific plate. After ∼120 Ma, nearly head-on subduction involving minor dextral transpression gave rise to voluminous continent-building juvenile and recycled magmas of the Sierran arc, providing the erosional debris to the Great Valley fore arc and Franciscan trench.},

 abstract = {Principal component analysis (PCA) or singular value decomposition (SVD) are multivariate techniques that are often used to compress large data matrices to a relevant size. Subsequent data analysis then proceeds with the model representation of the data. In this first paper expressions are derived for the prediction of the bias in the eigenvalues of PCA and singular values of SVD that results from random measurement errors in the data. Theoretical expressions for the prediction of this "random error bias" have been given in the statistics literature. These results are, however, restricted to the case that only one principal component (PC) is significant. The first objective of this paper is to extend these results to an arbitrary number of significant PCs. For the generalization Malinowski's error functions are used. A signal-to-noise ratio is defined that describes the error situation for each individual PC. This definition enhances the interpretability of the derived expressions. The adequacy of the derived expressions is tested by a limited Monte Carlo study. This finally leads to the second objective of this paper. Simulation results are always restricted to the class of data that is well represented in the study. Thus rather than giving extensive simulation results it is outlined how the validation and evaluation of theoretical predictions can proceed for a specific application in practice. ?? 1995.},

 abstract = {Multivariate calibration aims to model the relation between a dependent variable, e.g. analyte concentration, and the measured independent variables, e.g. spectra, for complex mixtures. The model parameters are obtained in the form of a regression vector from calibration data by regression methods such as principal component regression (PCR) or partial least squares (PLS). Subsequently, this regression vector is used to predict the dependent variable for unknown mixtures. The validation of the obtained predictions is a crucial part of the procedure, i.e. together with the point estimate an interval estimate is desired. The associated prediction intervals can be constructed from the covariance matrix of the estimated regression vector. However, currently known expressions for PCR and PLS are derived within the classical regression framework, i.e. they only take the uncertainty in the dependent variable into account. This severely limits their capability for establishing realistic prediction intervals in practical situations. In this paper, expressions are derived using the method of error propagation that also account for the measurement errors in the independent variables. An exact linear relation is assumed between the dependent and independent variables. The obtained expressions are therefore valid for the classical errors-in-variables (EIV) model. In order to make the presentation reasonably self-contained, relevant expressions are reviewed for the classical regression model as well as the classical EIV model, especially for ordinary least squares (OLS). The consequences for the limit of detection, wavelength selection, sample selection and local modeling are discussed. Diagnostics are proposed to determine the adequacy of the approximations used in the derivations. Finally, PCR and PLS are so-called biased regression methods. Compared with OLS, they yield small variance at the expense of increased bias. It follows that bias may be an important ingredient of the obtained predictions. Therefore considerable attention is paid to the quantification of bias and new stopping rules for model selection in PCR and PLS are proposed. The theoretical ideas are illustrated by the analysis of real data taken from the literature (classical regression model) as well as simulated data (classical EIV model).},

 abstract = {We report observations from a kilometer-scale thrust ramp on the Naukluft thrust, Namibia. The Naukluft thrust is a low angle thrust that was active at subgreenschist facies conditions and accommodated several tens of kilometers of displacement at the base of the Naukluft Nappe Complex in the Pan-African Damara Orogeny. The fault zone is generally planar and a few meters thick, comprising predominantly a dolomite-rich cataclasite. At the ramp, the fault-rock assemblage increases in thickness, and the hanging-wall, which elsewhere is relatively intact, contains a high density network of inclined quartz veins, subvertical dolomite and calcite veins, breccia zones, as well as injectites of cataclastic fault rock emanating from the fault surface. The geometry of the hanging-wall structures indicates local subhorizontal extension. Local tensile stress can be explained by bending in the hanging-wall as it deformed to slide above the ramp structure. High fluid pressures created dynamically during fast slip by decarbonation of carbonate fault rock, and by dewatering of the footwall under an impermeable fault during interseismic periods, led to additional reduction in local effective compressive stresses. In this location, the ramp is more optimally oriented for slip in the inferred regional stress field, and therefore likely to fail before the contiguous thrust flats that are subparallel to the maximum principal stress. As such, the ramp represents the likely location for nucleation of fault slip, which could both trigger dynamic failure of the adjacent thrust faults, and produce hanging-wall extensional structures. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

 abstract = {Many features of the Martian landscape are thought to have been formed by liquid water flow and water-related mineralogies on the surface of Mars are widespread and abundant. Several lines of evidence, however, suggest that Mars has been cold with mean global temperatures well below the freezing point of pure water. Martian climate modellers considering a combination of greenhouse gases at a range of partial pressures find it challenging to simulate global mean Martian surface temperatures above 273 K, and local thermal sources cannot account for the widespread distribution of hydrated and evaporitic minerals throughout the Martian landscape. Solutes could depress the melting point of water in a frozen Martian environment, providing a plausible solution to the early Mars climate paradox. Here we model the freezing and evaporation processes of Martian fluids with a composition resulting from the weathering of basalts, as reflected in the chemical compositions at Mars landing sites. Our results show that a significant fraction of weathering fluids loaded with Si, Fe, S, Mg, Ca, Cl, Na, K and Al remain in the liquid state at temperatures well below 273 K. We tested our model by analysing the mineralogies yielded by the evolution of the solutions: the resulting mineral assemblages are analogous to those actually identified on the Martian surface. This stability against freezing of Martian fluids can explain saline liquid water activity on the surface of Mars at mean global temperatures well below 273 K.},

Those basalts \{$\backslash$textless\}1 m.y. in age, and the majority of those 3-5 m.y. old, belong to Group 1 defined by high epsilon Nd values (7.6 to 9.3), low Sr-87/Sr-86 (0.7028 to 0.7040), low whole rock delta(18)O (5.8 parts per thousand to 6.4 parts per thousand), and a restricted range of Pb isotopic compositions that generally plot on the mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORE) portion of the northern hemisphere reference line. The 3 to 5-m.y.-old basalts have rare earth element (REE) and other incompatible element abundances that increase regularly with decreasing \{$\backslash$\%\}MgO and apparently have undergone more extensive differentiation than the younger, \{$\backslash$textless\}1 m.y.-old basalts. The Group 2 and 3 basalts are minor constituents of the preserved volcanic material, but are consistently older (5-7.6 m.y.) and have lower epsilon Nd (5.1 to 7.5) values than the Group 1 basalts. These basalts have distinctive trace element signatures, with the Group 2 basalts having higher Ni, lower Hf, and slightly lower middle REE abundances than the Group 1 basalts, while the Group 3 basalts are characterized by higher and more fractionated REE abundances, as well as higher Ca, P, Ti, Th, Ta, and Sc contents. The isotopic and trace element characteristics of all the basalts are interpreted to have been largely inherited from their mantle source regions. The isotopic compositions of the Group 1 basalts overlap the values for Pacific MORE and for late Cenozoic basalts in the California Coast Ranges interpreted to have been derived from upwelling MORE asthenosphere. We suggest that the Group 1 basalts were all derived from light REE (LREE)-enriched portions of the Pacific MORE source, which rose into the slab ''gap'' that developed beneath the southwestern United States during the late Cenozoic transition from a convergent to a transform plate margin. The Group 2 and 3 basalts either represent smaller degrees of melting of the MORE source, or melting of mafic portions of the subcontinental lithospheric mantle currently present beneath the region. Ancient, LREE-enriched mantle lithosphere has not been a primary source of basaltic magmatism in this region at any time over the past 8 m.y.},

@article{Fassett2008,
 abstract = {Valley networks, concentrations of dendritic channels that often suggest widespread pluvial and fluvial activity, have been cited as indicators that the climate of Mars differed significantly in the past from the present hyperarid cold desert conditions. Some researchers suggest that the change in climate was abrupt, while others favor a much more gradual transition. Thus, the precise timing of valley network formation is critical to understanding the climate history on Mars. We examine thirty valley network-incised regions on Mars, including both cratered upland valley networks and those outside the uplands, and apply a buffered crater counting technique to directly constrain when valley network formation occurred. The crater populations that we derive using this approach allow assessment of the timing of the last activity in a valley network independent of the mapping of specific geological units. From these measurements we find that valley networks cluster into two subdivisions in terms characteristics and age: (1) valley network activity in the cratered highlands has an average cessation age at the Noachian-Hesperian boundary and all valleys that we crater counted are Early Hesperian or older. No evidence is found for valley networks in the cratered uplands of Late Hesperian or Amazonian age. The timing of the cessation of cratered upland valley network activity at the Noachian-Hesperian boundary also corresponds to a decline in the intensity of large crater formation and degradation and to the apparent end of phyllosilicate-type weathering. (2) A few valley network-incised regions formed outside of the cratered uplands on volcanic edifices, in association with younger impact craters, and on the rim of Valles Marineris. We applied our buffered crater counting technique to four such valleys, on the volcanoes Ceraunius Tholus, Hecates Tholus, and Alba Patera and on the rim of Echus Chasma, and find that each has distinctive and different Late Hesperian or Early Amazonian ages, indicating that valley networks formed from time to time in the post-Noachian period. Unlike the cratered upland valley networks, these isolated occurrences are very local and have been interpreted to represent local conditions (e.g., snowpack melted during periods of intrusive volcanic activity). In contrast to a gradual cessation in the formation of valley networks proposed by some workers, our new buffered crater counting results indicate a relatively abrupt cessation in the formation of the widespread cratered upland valley networks at approximately the end of the Noachian, followed only by episodic and very localized valley network formation in later Mars history, very likely due to specific conditions (e.g., local magmatic heating). These valley network ages and correlations are thus consistent with a major change in the near-surface aqueous environment on Mars at approximately the Noachian-Hesperian boundary. The Noachian environment supported surface running water and fluvial erosion across Mars in the cratered uplands, enhanced crater degradation, and a weathering environment favoring the formation of phyllosilicates. The Hesperian-Amazonian environment was more similar to the hyperarid cold desert of today, with valley networks forming only extremely rarely and confined to localized special conditions. Sources of water for these latter occurrences are likely to be related to periodic mobilization and equatorward migration of polar volatiles due to variations in spin-axis orbital parameters, and to periodic catastrophic emergence of groundwater. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

 abstract = {The geological record of early Mars displays a variety of features that indicate fundamental differences from more recent conditions. These include evidence for: (1) widespread aqueous alteration and phyllosilicate formation, (2) the existence of an active magnetic dynamo, (3) the erosion of extensive valley networks, some thousands of kilometers long, (4) a much more significant role of impact cratering, forming structures up to the scale of large basins, and (5) the construction of much of the Tharsis volcanic province. Mars also is likely to have had a much thicker atmosphere during this early period. We discuss and review the temporal relationships among these processes and conditions. Key observations from this analysis suggest the following: (1) the last large impact basins, Argyre, Isidis, and Hellas, all pre-date the end of valley network formation, potentially by several hundred million years, (2) the magnetic dynamo is likely to be ancient (pre-Hellas), since the center of Hellas and other young basins lack magnetic remanence, and (3) the period of phyllosilicate formation is not readily connected to the period of valley network formation. Concepts for the possible formation and evolution of life on Mars should address this time sequence of conditions. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

'Iddingsite' is less common than mixtures of chlorite and serpentine. In two flows the only alteration product near the bottom is 'iddingsite' but at higher levels in the same flow green ehloritic material replaces olivine. This variation is accompanied by an increase in the FeO/Fe2O3 ratio in the rock towards the flow top. Green alteration products may be converted to material optically identicaI with 'iddingsite' by heating in air at 600°C. Zoned patches of chloritic material have formed by crystallization of the late stage magmatic fluid, modified in composition by reactions with olivine and pyroxene.},

 abstract = {Nili Patera is a 50 km diameter caldera at the center of the Syrtis Major Planum volcanic province. The caldera is unique among Martian volcanic terrains in hosting: (i) evidence of both effusive and explosive volcanism, (ii) hydrothermal silica, and (iii) compositional diversity from olivine-rich basalts to silica-enriched units. We have produced a new geological map using three mosaicked 18 m/pixel Context Camera digital elevation models, supplemented by Compact Remote Imaging Spectrometer for Mars Hyperspectral data. The map contextualizes these discoveries, formulating a stratigraphy in which Nili Patera formed by trapdoor collapse into a volcanotectonic depression. The distinctive bright floor of Nili Patera formed either as part of a felsic pluton, exposed during caldera formation, or as remnants of welded ignimbrite(s) associated with caldera formation—both scenarios deriving from melting in the Noachian highland basement. After caldera collapse, there were five magmatic episodes: (1) a basaltic unit in the caldera's north, (2) a silica-enriched unit and the associated Nili Tholus cone, (3) an intrusive event, forming a ̃300 m high elliptical dome; (4) an extrusive basaltic unit, emplaced from small cones in the east; and (5) an extreme olivine-bearing unit, formed on the western caldera ring fault. The mapping, together with evidence for hydrated materials, implies magmatic interaction with subsurface volatiles. This, in an area of elevated geothermal gradient, presents a possible habitable environment (sampled by the hydrothermal deposits). Additionally, similarities to other highland volcanoes imply similar mechanisms and thus astrobiological potential within those edifices.},

 abstract = {This paper focuses on the confidence bands of errors-in-variables regression lines applied to method comparison studies. When comparing two measurement methods, the goal is to 'proof' that they are equivalent. Without analytical bias, they must provide the same results on average notwithstanding the errors of measurement. The results should not be far from the identity line Y = X (slope (b) equal to 1 and intercept (a) equal to 0). A joint-CI is ideally used to test this joint hypothesis and the measurement errors in both axes must be taken into account. DR (Deming Regression) and BLS (Bivariate Least Square regression) regressions provide consistent estimated lines (confounded under homoscedasticity). Their joint-CI with a shape of ellipse in a (b;a) plane already exist in the literature. However, this paper proposes to transform these joint-CI into hyperbolic confidence bands for the line in the (X;Y) plane which are easier to display and interpret. Four methodologies are proposed based on previous papers and their properties and advantages are discussed. The proposed confidence bands are mathematically identical to the ellipses but a detailed comparison is provided with simulations and real data.When the error variances are known, the coverage probabilities are very close to each other but the joint-CI computed with the maximum likelihood (ML) or the method of moments provide slightly better coverage probabilities. Under unknown and heteroscedastic error variances, the ML coverage probabilities drop drastically while the BLS provide better coverage probabilities.},

 abstract = {Ultramafic inclusions from San Carlos, Arizona, are classified into two groups. Group I inclusions are dominated by magnesian (Mg/Mg + ΣFe = 0.86 – 0.91), olivine-rich peridotites containing Cr-rich clinopyroxene and spinel. The less abundant Group I pyroxenites (containing Mg- and Cr-rich pyroxenes) occur as discrete inclusions and as portions of composite inclusions where they have a sharp, planar interface with lherzolite. Group II inclusions are dominated by clinopyroxene-rich peridotites containing Al- and Ti-rich augite and commonly abundant, Al-rich spinel. Compared to Group I inclusions, they are more Fe-rich (Mg/Mg + ΣFe = 0.62 – 0.78) and more hetereogeneous in composition and modal proportions. Similar groups occur at many ultramafic inclusion localities. Our petrographic and geochemical results lead to the following conclusions. Olivine-rich Group I inclusions are not genetically related to the host basanite, and they are formed from two components. Component A is a partial melting residue; it comprises the major portion of these inclusions and determines the modal mineralogy and major and compatible trace element composition. Component B results from a small degree (5\%) of garnet peridotite melting (probably, within the low-velocity zone). This highly LIL-element-enriched melt has migrated upwards into the overlying component A where it crystallized primarily as clinopyroxene and amphibole, and thus, introduced LIL elements into the residual component A. Subsequent cooling and subsolidus recrystallization have removed textural evidence of this mixing. This model has also been proposed for olivine-rich Group I inclusions from Victoria, Australia. At Victoria and San Carlos some relatively clinopyroxene-rich Group I lherzolites are not contaminated by component B, and they represent the best estimates of upper mantle composition prior to melting. Group I orthopyroxenites may be fragments of tectonic layers formed in lherzolite, but they could also be early cumulates (now metamorphosed) from the melt in equilibrium with component A. Group I clinopyroxenites have geochemical features of clinopyroxene in equilibrium with a magma. Thus, they could also represent early cumulates (now metamorphosed) from a magma unrelated to the host basanite. Alternatively, their geochemical characteristics could result from more complex models such as residues from partial remelting of pyroxenite dikes and veins or intradike segregation processes such as filter pressing. All Group II inclusions studied appear to be cumulates derived from a SiO2-undersaturated magma, possibly an early magma in the same volcanic episode which culminated with eruption of the host basanite. The poikilitic texture of amphibole-rich (kaersutite) inclusions is consistent with a cumulate origin. The bulk compositions of Group II inclusions are not equivalent to typical basaltic compositions.},

 abstract = {Published stable isotope records in marine carbonate are characterized by a positive δ18O excursion associated with a negative δ13C shift during the early Maastrichtian. However, the cause and even the precise timing of these excursions remain uncertain. We have generated high-resolution foraminiferal stable isotope and grey scale records for the latest Campanian to early Maastrichtian (̃73-68 Ma) at two Ocean Drilling Program sites, 525 (Walvis Ridge) and 690 (Weddell Sea). We demonstrate that the negative δ13C excursion is decoupled from the δ18O increase with a lag of about 600 kyr. Our δ13C records (both planktic and benthic) show an amplitude for the negative excursion of 0.7 ‰ that falls between about 72.1 and 70.7 Ma. Our planktic δ18O records indicate an overall increase of 1.2 ‰ from 73 to 68 Ma at Site 690, whereas at Site 525 they record a slightly smaller increase (̃1 ‰) that peaks around 70.1 Ma with decreasing values thereafter. Our benthic δ18O data indicate an increase of ̃1.5 ‰ at Site 525 and ̃0.7 ‰ at Site 690 between about 71.4 and 69.9 Ma. Benthic δ18O values show different baseline values at the two sites before and after the excursion but the larger increase at Site 525 means that the values attained at the peak of the excursion are similar at the two sites. We interpret this observation in terms of water mass changes. The excursion is interpreted to reflect a cooling of bottom waters in response to the strengthening contribution of intermediate- to deep-water production in the high southern latitudes rather than increased ice volume. The associated carbon-cycle perturbations that we observe are interpreted to reflect a weakening of surface-water stratification and increased productivity, as supported by our grey value data.},

 abstract = {Within the Pan-African Gariep Belt in southwestern Africa a para-autochthonous, predominantly sedimentary sequence, deposited in a rift graben and subsequently on a passive continental margin with a Kibaran basement, is distinguished from an allochthonous, predominantly oceanic terrane that was thrust on top of the former during collision of the Rio de la Plata and the Kalahari plates. 40Ar/39Ar mineral cooling ages presented here set the following constraints: after Kibaran high-grade metamorphism, the consolidated basement cooled through \textasciitilde{}300°C at 1006 Ma. Rifting between 781 and 741 Ma was followed by the formation of oceanic crust, the lower parts of which cooled through 500°C sometime between 630 and 600 Ma. After inversion from extension to compression, some of the oceanic crustal material was shredded oﬀ and incorporated into an accretionary wedge—a process that is indirectly dated between 573–576 Ma by hornblende plateau ages. Continent–continent collision and thrusting of the internal onto the external zones of the tectonic belt culminated between 547–543 Ma as indicated by further hornblende plateau ages. Muscovite cooling ages for the internal zone are between 526 and 529 Ma, those for the tectonically deeper, external zone are 483 Ma in the north and between 495–506 Ma in the south of the belt. In conjunction with published data, these results suggest successive closure of ﬁrst the northern Adamastor ocean ( Kaoko Belt), followed by the Khomas sea (intracontinental Damara Belt), and ﬁnally the southern Adamastor ocean (Gariep Belt). © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.},

 abstract = {A basin-like area containing three interior layer deposits (ILDs) on the southern margin of Coprates Chasma was studied. We interpret the area as an ancestral basin and demonstrate that ILD deposition postdates the formation of the current wall rock slopes. The geometry of the ILD and the wall rock spurs form a catchment area between each ILD and the plateau to the south. Erosional remnants of extensive ash or dust layers deposited on the plateau south of Valles Marineris also crop out on the southern plateau of Coprates Chasma. A mass balance calculation suggests that the volume of each ILD is compatible with the volume of the ash or dust that would have been deposited within each catchment area. We propose that the ILDs likely formed by episodically washing such aerially deposited material down from chasma walls. Rifting of the Ius-Melas-Coprates graben opened the enclosed basin and removed any standing water. Faults within the ILDs are compatible with this chasm opening. Sulfates are associated with the ILDs and light-toned material on the basin floor. We suggest that they result from water alteration of preexisting deposits, though the timing of that alteration may predate or postdate the breaching of the basin. Scours within one ILD are similar to terrestrial glacial scours. During a period of high obliquity ice would accumulate in this region; hence we argue the scours are Martian glacial scours. A late deposited layer marks the end of the active local geological history between 100 My and 1 Gy.},

@article{Fuis1998,
 abstract = {A comparison of the deep structure along nine recent transects of the west margin of North America shows many important similarities and differences. Common tectonic elements identified in the deep structure along these transects include actively subducting oceanic crust, accreted oceanic/arc (or oceanic-like) lithosphere of Mesozoic through Cenozoic ages, Cenozoic accretionary prisms, Mesozoic accretionary prisms, backstops to the Mesozoic prisms, and undivided lower crust. Not all of these elements are present along all transects. In this study, nine transects, including four crossing subduction zones and five crossing transform faults, are plotted at the same scale and vertical exaggeration (V.E. 1:1), using the above scheme for identifying tectonic elements. The four subduction-zone transects contain actively subducting oceanic crust, Cenozoic accretionary prisms, and bodies of basaltic rocks accreted in the Cenozoic, including remnants of a large, oceanic plateau in the Oregon and Vancouver Island transects. Rocks of age and composition (Eocene basalt) similar to the oceanic plateau are currently subducting in southern Alaska, where they are doubled up on top of Pacific oceanic crust and have apparently created a giant asperity, or impediment to subduction. Most of the subduction-zone transects also contain Mesozoic accretionary prisms, and two of them, Vancouver Island and Alaska, also contain thick, tectonically underplated bodies of late Mesozoic/early Cenozoic oceanic lithosphere, interpreted as fragments of the extinct Kula plate. In the upper crust, most of the five transform-fault transects (all in California) reflect: (1) tectonic wedging of a Mesozoic accretionary prism into a backstop, which includes Mesozoic/early Cenozoic forearc rocks and Mesozoic ophiolitic/arc basement rocks; and (2) shuffling of the subduction margin of California by strike-slip faulting. In the lower crust, they may reflect migration of the Mendocino triple junction northward (seen in rocks east of the San Andreas fault) and cessation of Farallon-plate subduction (seen in rocks west of the San Andreas fault). In northern California, lower-crustal rocks east of the San Andreas fault have oceanic-crustal velocity and thickness and contain patches of high reflectivity. They may represent basaltic rocks magmatically underplated in the wake of the migration of the Mendocino triple junction, or they may represent stalled, subducted fragments of the Farallon/Gorda plate. The latter alternative does not fit the accepted "slabless window" model for the migration of the triple junction. This lower-crustal layer and the Moho are offset at the San Andreas and Maacama faults. In central California, a similar lower-crustal layer is observed west of the San Andreas fault. West of the continental slope, it is Pacific oceanic crust, but beneath the continent it may represent either Pacific oceanic crust, stalled, subducted fragments (microplates) of the Farallon plate, or basaltic rocks magmatically underplated during subduction of the Pacific/Farallon ridge or during breakup of the subducted Farallon plate. The transect in southern California is only partly representative of regional structure, as the structure here is 3-dimensional. In the upper crust, a Mesozoic prism has been thrust beneath crystalline basement rocks of the San Gabriel Mountains and Mojave Desert. In the mid-crust, a bright reflective zone is interpreted as a possible "master" decollement that can be traced from the fold-and-thrust belt of the Los Angeles basin northward to at least the San Andreas fault. A Moho depression beneath the San Gabriel Mountains is consistent with downwelling of lithospheric mantle beneath the Transverse Ranges that appears to be driving the compression across the Transverse Ranges and Los Angeles basin.},

A set of framework geotherms for the continental lithosphere explains deep crustal melting in high heat flow regions, metamorphic pressure-temperature (P-T) space in the crust, partial melting at the base of the lithosphere to produce an S-wave low-velocity zone in Phanerozoic and younger terranes, and the P-T fields inferred from mantle xenoliths. Important perturbations to a standard thermal state are produced by orogenic overprints, transient thermal regimes, and exhumation.},

 abstract = {We consider the hypothesis that Mars never experienced an early warm, wet period and the implications of a continuously cold Martian climate for the hydrology and geochemistry of the planet. Geomorphic evidence previously interpreted to indicate a more temperate early climate can be explained by cold climate processes and the transient flow of liquid water at the surface rather than a terrestrial-like hydrological cycle. In this scenario, freezing and confinement of crustal aquifers lead to the eruption of water or brines to the surface: Hesperian events formed massive ice sheets, and triggered floods that carved the outflow channels, while smaller, present-day aqueous eruptions are responsible for the seepage and gully-like landforms identified in high-resolution imaging. This process may have fluxed a significant volume of groundwater to the surface and the polar caps. A primordial source of groundwater reconciles the present D/H isotopic ratio of the atmosphere with fractionating atmospheric escape and a primordial Martian D/H inferred from hydrous phases of SNC meteorites. A cold early climate and a thin CO2 atmosphere are consistent with the ubiquity of primary igneous minerals and the apparent absence of secondary minerals and copious carbonates on the surface. Aqueous eruptions introduced soluble chloride and sulfate salts into Martian soils, leaving clays and carbonates within the crust. If the Martian crust hosts a deep biosphere, aqueous eruptions can bring organisms or their chemical signature to the surface. The biotic component of any recent eruptions may be preserved in transient ice in cold traps on the surface.},

 abstract = {Forty two major (Na, Mg, Ti and Mn) and trace elements covering the mass range from Li to U in three USGS basalt glass reference materials BCR-2G, BHVO-2G and BIR-1G were determined using laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. Calibration was performed using NIST SRM 610 in conjunction with internal standardisation using Ca. Determinations were also made on NIST SRM 612 and 614 as well as NIST SRM 610 as unknown samples, and included forty five major (Al and Na) and trace elements. Relative standard deviation (RSD) of determinations was below 10\% for most elements in all the glasses under investigation. Consistent exceptions were Sn and Sb in BCR-2G, BHVO-2G and BIR-1G. For BCR-2G, BHVO-2G and BIR-1G, clear negative correlations on a logarithmic scale exist between RSD and concentration for elements lower than 1500 µg g-1 with logarithmic correlation coefficients between -0.75 and -0.86. There is also a clear trend of increasing RSD with decreasing concentration from NIST SRM 610 through SRM 612 to SRM 614. These suggest that the difference in the scatter of apparent element concentrations is not due to chemical heterogeneity but reflects analytical uncertainty. It is concluded that all these glasses are, overall, homogeneous on a scale of 60 µm. Our first results on BHVO-2G and BIR-1G showed that they generally agreed with BHVO-2/BHVO-1 and BIR-1 within 10\% relative. Exceptions were Nb, Ta and Pb in BHVO-2G, which were 14-45\% lower than reference values for BHVO-2 and BHVO-1. Be, Ni, Zn, Y, Zr, Nb, Sn, Sb, Gd, Tb, Er, Pb and U in BIR-1G were also exceptions. However, of these elements, Be, Nb, Sn, Sb, Gd, Tb, Pb and U gave results that were consistent within an uncertainty of 2s between our data and BIR-1 reference values. Results on NIST SRM 612 agreed well with published data, except for Mg and Sn. This was also true for elements with m/z  85 (Rb) in the case of NIST SRM 614.},

@article{Garcia-Castellanos2009,
 abstract = {The Mediterranean Sea became disconnected from the world's oceans and mostly desiccated by evaporation about 5.6 million years ago during the Messinian salinity crisis. The Atlantic waters found a way through the present Gibraltar Strait and rapidly refilled the Mediterranean 5.33 million years ago in an event known as the Zanclean flood. The nature, abruptness and evolution of this flood remain poorly constrained. Borehole and seismic data show incisions over 250 m deep on both sides of the Gibraltar Strait that have previously been attributed to fluvial erosion during the desiccation. Here we show the continuity of this 200-km-long channel across the strait and explain its morphology as the result of erosion by the flooding waters, adopting an incision model validated in mountain rivers. This model in turn allows us to estimate the duration of the flood. Although the available data are limited, our findings suggest that the feedback between water flow and incision in the early stages of flooding imply discharges of about 10(8) m(3) s(-1) (three orders of magnitude larger than the present Amazon River) and incision rates above 0.4 m per day. Although the flood started at low water discharges that may have lasted for up to several thousand years, our results suggest that 90 per cent of the water was transferred in a short period ranging from a few months to two years. This extremely abrupt flood may have involved peak rates of sea level rise in the Mediterranean of more than ten metres per day.},

The U-Pb system is particularly powerful because three chronometers are available (238U→206Pb, 235U→207Pb, and 232Th→208Pb), but challenges arise because of complexities from inheritance and Pb loss. Ages can be used to constrain the age of deposition of the host sediment, reconstruct provenance, characterize a sedimentary unit, and characterize many different aspects of source regions.

 abstract = {The Nama Group in South West Africa is subdivided slightly differently and in greater detail than before. The lower shelf deposits were supplied mainly from the easterly Kalahari shield and the more feldspathic and more detrital reddish upper sediments from uplifted regions of the inferred adjacent Damara geosyncline, which probably formed part of the extensive Pan-African Geosyncline to the west and north. There is much evidence of severe climatic conditions and volcanism having existed. This group and the underlying Gariep Group appear to represent a single geotectonic cycle, towards the end of which the Nama Group was deposited. The fauna found in the Nama Group seems to indicate a Vendian (Ediacarian) age for the lower Nama Group but the age for the upper Nama Group is uncertain. The Ediacara fauna in Australia and the related Nama fauna have only one identical fossil thus far. The Nama Group is a good test for the model of Valentine and Moores (1972) and in general confirms it. The Nama Group is considered to be younger than the base of the Mulden Group to the north.},

 abstract = {The case for an ocean having once occupied the northern lowlands of Mars has largely been based indirectly on the debouching of the outflow channels into the lowlands, and directly on erosional features along the margins of the lowlands interpreted to be the result of wave action. Two global shorelines were previously mapped from albedo variation, embayment relationships, and scarps interpreted as coastal cliffs. However, not since the early, Viking-based studies, has there been a focused assessment of the presence or absence of coastal constructional landforms such as barrier ridges and spits, located on or near the mapped "shorelines." Such constructional landforms are typically found in association with coastal erosional features on Earth, and therefore warrant a detailed search for their presence on Mars. All presently available THEMIS VIS and MOC NA images located on or near either of the two "shorelines," within the Chryse Planitia/Arabia Terra region (10° to 44° N; 300° to 0° E) and the Isidis Planitia region (0° to 30° N; 70° to 105° E), were examined in search of any features that could reasonably be considered candidate coastal ridges. Additionally, raw MOLA profiles were used in conjunction with a technique developed from Differential Global Positioning System profiles across terrestrial paleo-shorelines, to search for coastal ridges throughout these same regions. Out of 447 THEMIS VIS and 735 MOC NA images examined, only four candidates are observed that are plausibly interpreted as coastal ridges; no candidate coastal ridges are observed in the MOLA profiles. This overwhelming paucity of candidate features suggests one of five possible scenarios in terms of the existence of standing bodies of water within the martian lowlands: (1) No ocean existed up to the level of either of the previously mapped "shorelines"; (2) An ocean existed, however wave action, the primary agent responsible for construction of coastal landforms, was minimal to non-existent; (3) An ocean existed, but sediment input was not significant enough to form coastal deposits; (4) An ocean existed, but readily froze, and over time sublimated; and lastly (5) An ocean existed and coastal landforms were constructed, but in the intervening time since their formation they have nearly all been eroded away. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

 abstract = {We investigate the distinctive distribution and pattern of subkilometer-sized cones in Isidis Planitia, and their relationship to the material that fills the basin. We observe that: (1) the cones show uniform size, spacing, and morphology across the entire basin; (2) they have large central depressions (relative to cone basal diameters) that are generally filled in and commonly show layering; (3) cone chains form highly organized spatial patterns; cones are also found in isolation and in dense fields; (4) many adjacent chains are parallel, and evenly spaced, creating a pattern that mimics lava flows that have experienced compressional folding; (5) no flows are associated with the cones, even where summit crater rims are breached; (6) the cones are at least temporally related to basin fill; (7) the basin fill material is largely fine-grained, but with locally indurated layers at shallow depth; blocks ejected by small craters from these locally indurated layers are commonly dark in color; and (8) relationships between cones along a chain show no systematic temporal formation sequence along the chain. We conclude that the basin was likely inundated by one or more hot, partially welded pyroclastic flows; devolatilization of these flows remobilized volcaniclastic material to form the cones without associated lava flows. The volume of gas required to account for the observed number of cones is low and does not require the presence of ground water or ice. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

 abstract = {Thermal diffusivity measurements of seven naturally deformed upper mantle rocks were made as a function of pressure ( up to 1 GPa), temperature (up to 1250 K), and the deformation fabric of the samples. For each sample the strain-induced crystal preferred orientations of olivine and pyroxenes were measured, and petrophysical models, based on the thermal diffusivity tensors of the olivine and enstatite crystals, were used to evaluate the three-dimensional distribution of the thermal diffusivity. Both model predictions and measurements show that the anisotropy of thermal diffusivity remains large at the rock scale: 15-28\%, depending on the strength of the olivine crystallographic fabric. The direction of maximum thermal diffusivity is parallel to the lineation ( flow direction), and the minimum of thermal diffusivity is normal to the foliation plane ( flow plane). This anisotropy is preserved at high temperature and pressure. However, measured thermal diffusivities are 20-30\% lower than model predictions. This discrepancy between measurements and model predictions cannot be explained by the presence of cracks in the samples because the closure of these void spaces, evaluated through the high-pressure experiments, is found to have a negligible effect on measured thermal diffusivities. Thermal diffusivity for all samples displays a weak linear dependence on pressure of similar to10\% GPa(-1). Thermal diffusivities observed in the high-temperature experiments ( 1000 1250 K) are compatible with a weak radiative contribution to the total heat diffusion.},

 abstract = {Tomographic studies of the mantle of southern California (USA) commonly found evidence for seismically high speed material, known as the Isabella anomaly, extending from near the base of the crust of the southwestern Sierra Nevada foothills into the asthenosphere. This anomaly has been interpreted to mark downwelling lithospheric material that had been removed from the southern Sierra Nevada. Using data from the Sierra Nevada EarthScope Project (SNEP) array, we investigate the lithosphere of the Sierra Nevada and surrounding region to better understand the process by which batholiths form dense lithospheric roots that become unstable and founder. Inverting phase velocities of fundamental mode Rayleigh waves for shear wave speeds provides observations of the distribution of high and low wave-speed anomalies, which correspond to portions of the batholith that formed an intact lithospheric root, and where seismically slower shallow asthenosphere marks areas where lithosphere has been removed. Our results corroborate previous observations that the southern Sierra Nevada has thin crust underlain by shallow asthenosphere. High shear wave velocity (Vs) material in the mantle beneath the southwestern foothills marks the location of the Isabella anomaly, to the east of which is a region of low Vs mantle where asthenosphere has risen to replace the delaminating root. Farther north, near the latitude of Long Valley, low velocities at shallow depths beneath the high elevations of the eastern Sierra indicate the presence of asthenosphere close to the base of the crust. Thicker high-speed material, however, underlies the western foothills of the Sierra Nevada at this latitude and dips to the east where it extends to depths of ∼100 km or more, giving it the appearance of a portion of lithosphere that has detached from the east but remains attached to the west as it is currently peeling off. The structure of the Sierra Nevada changes near the latitude of Lake Tahoe, where thinner lithosphere extends between depths of 40 and 80 km, but does not reach greater depths. It appears that the lithospheric material of the Sierra Nevada from latitudes close to Lake Tahoe, and continuing to the north, is not being removed, indicating a change between the structure and evolution of the southern and northern Sierra Nevada.},

 abstract = {The 18O/16O and 13C/12C ratios of carbonate minerals formed by supergene oxidation of Zn-Pb deposits and submarine alteration of ancient slags were studied in order to constrain isotope fractionation factors for smithsonite, cerussite, and phosgenite, and to characterize conditions of nonsulfide ore formation. We present new isotope data of carbonate-hosted ores from the Iglesiente district (Sardinia, Italy) and Vila Ruiva (Portugal), as well as from the silicate-hosted ores of the Broken Hill district, New South Wales (Australia) and Freihung (Germany) and review previously published isotope data. The temperature dependence of oxygen isotope fractionation between Pb and Zn carbonate minerals and water below 240~°C for cerussite and below 100~°C for smithsonite and phosgenite can be expressed as1000lnαcerussite-water = 2.29(106 / T2) - 3.561000lnαsmithsonite-water = 3.10(106 / T2) - 3.501000lnαphosgenite-water = 2.55(106 / T2) - 3.50with T in Kelvin. The carbon isotope fractionation between smithsonite, phosgenite, hydrozincite and calcite is less than about 2‰, while cerussites are strongly depleted in 13C by about 10‰ as compared to the former minerals. Oxygen isotope variations of individual carbonate minerals within a deposit are relatively small indicating constant formation temperatures and a single, meteoric fluid source. Average formation temperatures of the studied deposits are calculated at 20 ± 5~°C using the estimated isotope compositions of local paleometeoric waters. We observe a linear relationship between the isotope values of estimated paleometeoric waters and supergene carbonates. Thus, base metal carbonate minerals from supergene deposits may provide paleoclimatic information. The carbon isotope values are in most carbonate-hosted deposits highly variable (more than 10‰) suggesting at least two isotopically distinct carbon sources. The isotopically light component can be related to oxidation of C3 plants (soil-derived carbon) and/or microbes that take active part in sulfide oxidation, while the isotopically heavy component originates from carbonate carbon from wall rocks and/or atmospheric carbon. The 13C-enriched component is less dominant in silicate-hosted deposits. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

 abstract = {Uzboi Vallis (centered at \$28°S, 323°E) is \$400 km long and comprises the southernmost segment of the northward-draining Uzboi–Ladon–Morava (ULM) meso-scale outﬂow system that emerges from Argyre basin. Bond and Holden craters blocked the valley to the south and north, respectively, forming a Late Noachian-to-Hesperian paleolake basin that exceeded 4000 km3. Limited CRISM data suggest lake deposits in Uzboi and underlying basin ﬂoor incorporate relatively more Mg-clays and more Fe-clays, respectively. The short-lived lake overﬂowed and breached Holden crater’s rim at an elevation of À350 m and rapidly drained into the crater. Fan deltas in Holden extend 25 km from the breach and incorporate meter-sized blocks, and longitudinal grooves along the Uzboi basin ﬂoor are hundreds of meters long and average 60 m wide, suggesting high-discharge drainage of the lake. Precipitation-derived runoff rather than regional groundwater or overﬂow from Argyre dominated contributions to the Uzboi lake, although the failure of most tributaries to respond to a lowering of base level indicates their incision largely ended when the lake drained. The Uzboi lake may have coincided with alluvial and/or lacustrine activity in Holden, Eberswalde, and other craters in southern Margaritifer Terra, where ﬂuvial/lacustrine activity may have required widespread, synoptic precipitation (rain or snow), perhaps associated with an ephemeral, global hydrologic system during the Late Noachian into the Hesperian on Mars.},

 abstract = {Forty-three 40Ar/39Ar step-heating experiments on white mica, biotite, hornblende and whole rocks from the Damara Orogen, Namibia revise and refine the regional perspective on cooling, exhumation, and tectonic reactivation across the orogen. These data also document post-orogenic motion on major shear zones and the thermal effects of late-syn to post-tectonic granite intrusions. These data show regional cooling through temperatures of ∼300-350 °C from 545 to 520 Ma in the Central Kaoko Zone, 530-510 Ma in the Eastern Kaoko Zone, and 495-480 Ma in the Southern Zone of the Damara Belt. Discordant 40Ar/39Ar age spectra relate to (1) partial resetting of K-Ar isotopic system in micas by late-stage activity in the major Kaoko Belt shear zones such as the Purros and Three Palms Mylonite Zones, giving apparent ages of 467 ± 6, 481 ± 3 and ∼492 Ma, and (2) thermal effects from granitic plutions particularly in the Ugab Domain of the Southern Kaoko Belt (500-475 Ma) and in the granite-dominated Central Zone of the Damara Belt (490-460 Ma). Phyllites of the lower grade flank regions of the orogen record apparent 40Ar/39Ar mica crystallization ages of ∼517 Ma (Eastern Kaoko Zone), ∼526 Ma (Northern Zone, Damara Belt), and ∼568-553 Ma (Southern Foreland Zone, Damara Belt). The Southern Foreland samples, however, are maximum ages, due to variable influence of detrital mica. Rates of cooling vary between zones within the Kaoko Belt. In the Central Kaoko Belt hornblende, biotite and white mica apparent 40Ar/39Ar ages are similar, suggestive of rapid cooling through the 300-550 °C temperature range, whereas in the Orogen Core or Western Kaoko Belt hornblende and biotite apparent ages are older than the white mica ages, because the white micas record the reactivation of the main structures. These data support models of diachronous deformation and metamorphism of the component parts of the orogen, and suggest that Pan-African orogenesis in the Damara is broadly bracketed between 580 and 500 Ma with final movements through 480 Ma, and spans through the terminal amalgamation of Gondwana in the Kuunga Orogeny through the initiation of subduction under the Gondwana continental margin. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

 abstract = {This study investigates the internal anatomy and petrogenesis of the Tuolumne Intrusive Suite (TIS), which comprises metaluminous, high-potassium, calc-alkaline granitoids typical of the Sierra Nevada batholith. Although the TIS has often been cited as an example of a large magma chamber that cooled and fractionated from the margins inward, its geochemistry is inconsistent with closed-system fractionation. Most major elements are highly correlated with SiO2, but the scattered nature of trace elements and variations of initial Sr and Nd isotopic ratios indicate that fractional crystallization is not the predominant process responsible for its chemical evolution. Isotopic data suggest mixing between melts of mantle-like rocks and a granitic melt similar in composition to the highest-silica TIS unit. Monte Carlo models of magma mixing confirm that such processes can reproduce the observed variations in major elements, trace elements and isotopic ratios. Thermobarometry suggests emplacement at depths near 6 km and crystallization temperatures ranging from 660 to 750 8C. Feldspars, hornblende, biotite and magnetite exhibit evidence of extensive low-temperature subsolidus exsolution. The TIS as a whole trends toward more evolved isotopic compositions and younger U–Pb zircon ages passing inward. This pattern indicates a general increase in the proportion of felsic, crustally derived melt in the mixing process, which may have resulted from net accumulation of heat added to the lower crust by intrusion of mantle-derived mafic magma. However, the bulk geochemical and isotopic compositions of the equigranular Half Dome Granodiorite, the porphyritic Half Dome Granodiorite and the Cathedral Peak Granodiorite overlap one another and the contacts between them are commonly gradational. We interpret these map units to represent a single petrological continuum rather than distinct intrusive phases. The textural differences that define the units probably reflect thermal evolution of the system rather than distinct intrusive events.},

 abstract = {The Pan-African Damara orogenic system records Gondwana amalgamation involving serial suturing of the Congo-São Francisco and Ŕio de la Plata cratons (North Gondwana) from 580 to 550 Ma, before amalgamation with the Kalahari-Antarctic cratons (South Gondwana) as part of the 530 Ma Kuunga-Damara orogeny. Closure of the Adamastor Ocean was diachronous from the Araçuái Belt southwards, with peak sinistral transpressional deformation followed by craton overthrusting and foreland basin development at 580-550 Ma in the Kaoko Belt and at 545-530 Ma in the Gariep Belt. Peak deformation/metamorphism in the Damara Belt was at 530-500 Ma, with thrusting onto the Kalahari Craton from 495 Ma through to 480 Ma. Coupling of the Congo and Ŕio de la Plata cratons occurred before final closure of the Mozambique and Khomas (Damara Belt) oceans with the consequence that the Kuunga suture extends into Africa as the Damara Belt, and the Lufilian Arc and Zambezi Belt of Zambia. Palaeomagnetic data indicate that the Gondwana cratonic components were in close proximity by c. 550 Ma, so the last stages of the Damara-Kuunga orogeny were intracratonic, and led to eventual out-stepping of deformation/metamorphism to the Ross-Delamerian orogen (c. 520-500 Ma) along the leading edge of the Gondwana supercontinental margin. © The Geological Society of London 2008.},

 abstract = {An experimental study of the stability fields at high pressure of plagioclase peridotite, aluminous pyroxene (±spinel) peridotite and garnet peridotite, has been carried out in compositions matching estimates of the average undifferentiated upper mantle (pyrolite). The appearance of garnet at high pressures results from either of two complex reactions: 1.a.|spinel+pyroxene ⇌ olivine+garnet, (solid solutions)2.b.|aluminous pyroxene ⇌ garnet+pyroxene (lower Al2O3). (solid solution) In the model pyrolite composition, garnet appears at 21 kb (1100 °C) to 24 kb (1300 °C) by reaction (a) but at temperatures above 1300 °C spinel is absent from the low pressure assemblage and garnet develops by reaction (b) at pressures of 24 kb (1300 °C) to 31 kb (1500 °C). Reactions (a) and (b) have very different P, T gradients. In the garnet peridotite field, the amount of garnet is inversely proportional to the alumina content of the pyroxenes. This is confirmed by microprobe analyses of orthopyroxene (ranging from 6.0 to 2.2\% Al2O3, 0.7–0.9\% Cr2O3) coexisting with garnet, olivine and clinopyroxene. Coexisting clinopyroxenes have higher R2O3 content and exhibit a variable, temperature dependent enstatite solid solution. The experimental data are applied to estimate mineralogical, density and seismic velocity variations along oceanic and continental geothermal gradients in a pyrolite upper mantle. Although the mineralogical variation may produce a low velocity zone, the alternate explanation of incipient or minor partial melting is preferred. Experimental data on the maximum stability limit of amphibole in pyrolite (with 0.1–0.2\% water) are presented showing that amphibole breaks down to olivine+pyroxenes+garnet+fluid phase at approximately 29 kb, 1000 °C. The instability of amphibole at depths 80–90 km is considered to result in a zone of incipient or minor melting in a pyrolite upper mantle with 0.1–0.2\% water. The nature of the liquid in this zone is considered to be highly undersaturated olivine basanite or olivine nephelinite.},

 abstract = {Spinel lherzolite xenoliths within alkali basalts exposed at Rayfield River and Big Timothy Mountain, south-central British Columbia, represent samples of the underlying lithospheric mantle. Electron microprobe analysis shows that most xenoliths comprise compositionally homogeneous grains of olivine, orthopyroxene, clinopyroxene, and spinel. We applied the following mineral pair geothermometers to these rocks: orthopyroxene–clinopyroxene, spinel–orthopyroxene, and spinel–olivine. Temperatures calculated using the Brey and Köhler calibration of two-pyroxene thermometry were constrained in pressure by being required to lie on a model geotherm we develop for this region of B.C. The model geotherm is constrained to produce a temperature at the Moho (33 km) of 825 ± 25°C to match the lowest temperature peridotite xenoliths recovered in this study. Although the overall effect of pressure on the temperature calculations is negligible (̃2°C for 0.1 GPa), the simultaneous solution of the model geotherm and the pressure-dependent Brey–Köhler two-pyroxene thermometry removes the need for adopting an arbitrary pressure. We take these temperatures to represent peak mantle lithosphere temperatures. Fourteen Rayfield River xenoliths return two-pyroxene temperatures between 841 and 962°C corresponding to depths of 34–42 km. Orthopyroxene–spinel and olivine–spinel results are 889 ± 60 and 825 ± 88°C, respectively. Five Big Timothy xenoliths have two-pyroxene temperatures spanning 840–1058°C and corresponding to depths of 34–48 km. Mean orthopyroxene–spinel and olivine–spinel temperatures are 844 ± 63 and 896 ± 232°C, respectively. We argue that the differences in ranges of temperature do not represent closure temperatures imposed during cooling either in the mantle or during transport by the magma. Rather, these differences reflect differences in the original calibrations of the geothermometers or different degrees of equilibration in exchange reactions in dry rocks. Isochemical phase diagrams (pseudosections) constrain the pressure–temperature (P–T) field in which spinel is stable. These diagrams suggest that the spinel-bearing peridotites equilibrated at pressures ranging from ̃9.6 to 14 kbar (10 kbar = 1 GPa).},

 abstract = {The Nama foreland basin developed in Neoproterozoic times as a peripheral foreland basin between the Kalahari Craton in the east and the partly contemporaneous Damara and Gariep orogenic belts in the north and west. The foreland basin is subdivided into three basins, from north to south the Zaris, Witputs, and Vanrhynsdorp basins. Deposits of the Nama Group proper fill the first two basins, whereas the third contains the Vanrhynsdorp Group which differs in many aspects from the Nama Group. Only during its latest phase of development did the foreland basin form one continuous depository. The stratigraphic sequences in all three basins are suggested to be genetically related to orogenesis, flexural bulging and sea-level changes that affected the basin throughout its history. Palaeocurrent studies show that clastic sediments were initially derived from the craton and transported west and southwestwards in fluvial environments along the entire length of the basin. As mountain belts emerged along the interactive northern and western orogenic margins, transport directions switched to southerly and southeasterly. Foredeep flysch and ramp carbonates grade upwards into reddish conglomeratic molasse derived entirely from these orogens. Three major unconformity bounded sequences (composite sequences), probably of second-order cyclicity, can be recognised. The uppermost composite sequence (CS3) comprises the Fish River Subgroup, whereas the lower composite sequence (CS1) is composed of the Flaminkberg Formation and the Kwanous, Kuibis and lower and middle Schwarzrand subgroups. CS2 comprises the Knersvlakte, Brandkop and upper Schwarzrand subgroups. CS1 is composed of transgressive and highstand sequence sets onlapping the craton and truncated by a “Type 1” unconformity at the base of the Nomtsas Formation. CS2 contains a conformable lowstand flysch delta partly derived from CS1 deposits eroded on flexural bulges as well as an orogenic source in the northwest. CS3 is entirely composed of orogen-derived molasse onlapping a basal “Type 2” unconformity and overstepping older sequences in a cratonward direction. A number of intrabasinal unconformities is ascribed to flexural bulging in response to tectonic and sedimentary loading. The age of the Nama and Vanrhynsdorp groups is estimated at between 600 Ma and 530 Ma as determined by the age of the basement, the age of detrital micas and the age of subsequent thrust and fold tectonic events that vary in vergence from southeast to northeast, which affected Nama and Vanrhynsdorp rocks along the active basin margins. Marginal tectonogenesis of the Nama foreland basin resulted from northwesterly subduction of the Kalahari plate underneath the Congo and South American plates through a process of sinistral transpression along the western Kalahari margin leading to sequential closure of the proto-Atlantic (Adamastor) Ocean from north to south.},

In this study, we develop reconstructions of wildfire occurrence from tree-ring data col- lected from northwestern New Mexico to compare with a millennium-length dendroclimatic reconstruction of precipitation. Reconstructions of both wildfires and climate show simultaneous changes since AD 1700 that indicate climate forcing of wildfire regimes on interannual to century timescales. Following a centuries-long dry period with high fire frequency (c. AD 1400-1790), annual precipitation increased, fire frequency decreased, and the season of fire shifted from predominantly midsummer to late spring. We hypothesize that these shifts in fire regimes reflect long-term changes in rainfall patterns associated with changes in synoptic-scale atmospheric circulation patterns and the Southern Oscillation. Our evidence supports century-scale climate forcing of fire regimes in the American Southwest, providing a useful analogue of future wildfire regimes expected uinder changing global climate conditions.},

 abstract = {Stromatolites are attached, lithified sedimentary growth structures, accretionary away from a point or limited surface of initiation. Though the accretion process is commonly regarded to result from the sediment trapping or precipitation-inducing activities of microbial mats, little evidence of this process is preserved in most Precambrian stromatolites. The successful study and interpretation of stromatolites requires a process-based approach, oriented toward deconvolving the replacement textures of ancient stromatolites. The effects of diagenetic recrystallization first must be accounted for, followed by analysis of lamination textures and deduction of possible accretion mechanisms. Accretion hypotheses can be tested using numerical simulations based on modem stromatolite growth processes. Application of this approach has shown that stromatolites were originally formed largely through in situ precipitation of laminae during Archean and older Proterozoic times, but that younger Proterozoic stromatolites grew largely through the accretion of carbonate sediments, most likely through the physical process of microbial trapping and binding. This trend most likely reflects long-term evolution of the earth's environment rather than microbial communities.},

 abstract = {In the Precambrian world, devoid of higher organisms except near its end, carbonate sediments formed by a variety of abiotic and microbial processes, with patterns of deposition determined by tectonic, eustatic, and climatic processes. These ancient rocks demonstrate that the fundamental tenets of carbonate production and accumulation were initiated early in earth history, with the basic attributes of carbonate sedimentation well established by Neoproterozoic time. The broad temporal patterns of Precambrian carbonate facies composition and disposition parallel the long-term evolution of the earth's oceans and atmosphere. Archean and Paleoproterozoic carbonates commonly contain abundant sea-floor precipitates, whereas the Neoproterozoic record is dominated by clastic-textured facies and abundant carbonate mudstones; Mesoproterozoic carbonates are transitional. Mesoproterozoic and early Neoproterozoic carbonates also contain abundant quantitites of the enigmatic molar-tooth structure. Grainstones, dominated by giant ooids with centimeter-scale diameters, are characteristic of many Neoproterozoic carbonates. Texrurally unusual carbonates, featuring a reprise of Archean-style sea-floor precipitates, often cap glacial deposits of middle Neoproterozoic age. The influence of biology on sediment texture is best expressed in the history of Precambrian reefs. Archean through Mesoproterozoic reefs are dominantly stromatolite-based. Lamination textures reveal the progressive shift from in situ precipitation of aragonite and calcite encrusting the sea floor in Archean through Paleoproterozoic stromatolites to textures consistent with accretion of loose sediment through trapping and binding in Neoproterozoic stromatolites. This trend is interpreted to reflect the progressive decrease of abiotic factors and the concomittant increase of benthic microbial mats on controlling stromatolite growth. Neoproterozoic reefs witness the appearance of more complex textures that likely involve the participation of calcified microbes and noncalcified higher algae in colonizing the seafloor, increasing its surface complexity and resulting in highly porous frameworks for the first time in geologic history. Terminal Proterozoic thrombolitic reefs additionally contain the first calcified metazoans},

@article{Grotzinger2005Burns,
 abstract = {Outcrop exposures of sedimentary rocks at the Opportunity landing site (Meridiani Planum) form a set of genetically related strata defined here informally as the Burns formation. This formation can be subdivided into lower, middle, and upper units which, respectively, represent eolian dune, eolian sand sheet, and mixed eolian sand sheet and interdune facies associations. Collectively, these three units are at least 7 m thick and define a "wetting-upward" succession which records a progressive increase in the influence of groundwater and, ultimately, surface water in controlling primary depositional processes. The Burns lower unit is interpreted as a dry dune field (though grain composition indicates an evaporitic source), whose preserved record of large-scale cross-bedded sandstones indicates either superimposed bedforms of variable size or reactivation of lee-side slip faces by episodic (possibly seasonal) changes in wind direction. The boundary between the lower and middle units is a significant eolian deflation surface. This surface is interpreted to record eolian erosion down to the capillary fringe of the water table, where increased resistance to wind-induced erosion was promoted by increased sediment cohesiveness in the capillary fringe. The overlying Burns middle unit is characterized by fine-scale planar-laminated to low-angle-stratified sandstones. These sandstones accumulated during lateral migration of eolian impact ripples over the flat to gently undulating sand sheet surface. In terrestrial settings, sand sheets may form an intermediate environment between dune fields and interdune or playa surfaces. The contact between the middle and upper units of the Burns formation is interpreted as a diagenetic front, where recrystallization in the phreatic or capillary zones may have occurred. The upper unit of the Burns formation contains a mixture of sand sheet facies and interdune facies. Interdune facies include wavy bedding, irregular lamination with convolute bedding and possible small tepee or salt-ridge structures, and cm-scale festoon cross-lamination indicative of shallow subaqueous flows marked by current velocities of a few tens of cm/s. Most likely, these currents were gravity-driven, possibly unchannelized flows resulting from the flooding of interdune/ playa surfaces. However, evidence for lacustrine sedimentation, including mudstones or in situ bottom-growth evaporites, has not been observed so far at Eagle and Endurance craters. Mineralogical and elemental data indicate that the eolian sandstones of the lower and middle units, as well as the subaqueous and eolian deposits of the Burns upper unit, were derived from an evaporitic source. This indirectly points to a temporally equivalent playa where lacustrine evaporites or ground-water-generated efflorescent crusts were deflated to provide a source of sand-sized particles that were entrained to form eolian dunes and sand sheets. This process is responsible for the development of sulfate eolianites at White Sands, New Mexico, and could have provided a prolific flux of sulfate sediment at Meridiani. Though evidence for surface water in the Burns formation is mostly limited to the upper unit, the associated sulfate eolianites provide strong evidence for the critical role of groundwater in controlling sediment production and stratigraphic architecture throughout the formation. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

 abstract = {Carbonate rocks from the Middle Ediacaran period in locations all over the globe record the largest excursion in carbon isotopic compositions in Earth history. This finding suggests a dramatic reorganization of Earth's carbon cycle. Named the Shuram excursion for its original discovery in the Shuram Formation, Oman, the anomaly closely precedes impressive events in evolution, including the rise of large metazoans and the origin of biomineralization in animals. Instead of a true record of the carbon cycle at the time of sedimentation, the carbon isotope signature recorded in the Shuram excursion could be caused by alteration following deposition of the carbonate sediments, a scenario supported by several geochemical indicators. However, such secondary processes are intrinsically local, which makes it difficult to explain the coincident occurrence of carbon isotope anomalies in numerous records around the globe. Both possibilities are intriguing: if the Shuram excursion preserves a genuine record of ancient seawater chemistry, it reflects a perturbation to the carbon cycle that is stronger than any known perturbations of the modern Earth. If, however, it represents secondary alteration during burial of sediments, then marine sediments must have been globally preconditioned in a unique way, to allow ordinary and local processes to produce an extraordinary and widespread response.},

 abstract = {Eolian dune ﬁelds on Earth and Mars evolve as complex systems within a set of boundary conditions. A source-to-sink comparison indicates that although differences exist in sediment production and transport, the systems largely converge at the dune-ﬂow and pattern-development levels, but again differ in modes of accumulation and preservation. On Earth, where winds frequently exceed threshold speeds, dune ﬁelds are sourced primarily through deﬂation of subaqueous deposits as these sediments become available for transport. Limited weathering, widespread permafrost, and the lowdensity atmosphere on Mars imply that sediment production, sediment availability, and sand-transporting winds are all episodic. Possible sediment sources include relict sediments from the wetter Noachian; slow physical weathering in a cold, water-limited environment; and episodic sediment production associated with climatic cycles, outﬂow events, and impacts. Similarities in dune morphology, secondary airﬂow patterns over the dunes, and pattern evolution through dune interactions imply that dune stratiﬁcation and bounding surfaces on Mars are comparable to those on Earth, an observation supported by outcrops of the Burns formation. The accumulation of eolian deposits occurs on Earth through the dynamics of dry, wet, and stabilizing eolian systems. Dry-system accumulation by ﬂow deceleration into topographic basins has occurred throughout Martian history, whereas wetsystem accumulation with a rising capillary fringe is restricted to Noachian times. The greatest difference in accumulation occurs with stabilizing systems, as manifested by the north polar Planum Boreum cavi unit, where accumulation has occurred through stabilization by permafrost development. Preservation of eolian accumulations on Earth typically occurs by sediment burial within subsiding basins or a relative rise of the water table or sea level. Preservation on Mars, measured as the generation of a stratigraphic record and not time, has an Earth analog with inﬁll of impact-created and other basins, but differs with the cavi unit, where preservation is by burial beneath layered ice with a climatic driver.},

This intracrater lake system probably existed intermittently for thousands to millions of years, implying a relatively wet climate that supplied moisture to the crater rim and transported sediment via streams into the lake basin.

 abstract = {Photosynthesis is the process by which plants harvest sunlight to produce sugars from carbon dioxide and water. It is the primary source of energy for all life on Earth; hence it is important to understand how this process responds to climate change and human impact. However, model-based estimates of gross primary production (GPP, output from photosynthesis) are highly uncertain, in particular over heavily managed agricultural areas. Recent advances in spectroscopy enable the space-based monitoring of sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) from terrestrial plants. Here we demonstrate that spaceborne SIF retrievals provide a direct measure of the GPP of cropland and grassland ecosystems. Such a strong link with crop photosynthesis is not evident for traditional remotely sensed vegetation indices, nor for more complex carbon cycle models. We use SIF observations to provide a global perspective on agricultural productivity. Our SIF-based crop GPP estimates are 50-75\% higher than results from state-of-the-art carbon cycle models over, for example, the US Corn Belt and the Indo-Gangetic Plain, implying that current models severely underestimate the role of management. Our results indicate that SIF data can help us improve our global models for more accurate projections of agricultural productivity and climate impact on crop yields. Extension of our approach to other ecosystems, along with increased observational capabilities for SIF in the near future, holds the prospect of reducing uncertainties in the modeling of the current and future carbon cycle.},

 abstract = {The divergent plate boundary in Iceland consists of more than two dozen systems where most of the volcano-tectonic activity takes place. At the surface the volcanic systems are characterised by 5-20-km-wide and 40-100 km-long swarms of tension fractures (similar to 10(2) m long), normal faults (similar to 10(3) m long) and volcanic fissures. The Holocene fissure swarms are confined to less than 10,000-year-old basaltic lava flows, mostly pahoehoe, occurring near the centre of the active rift zone. In any particular swarm, the number of tension fractures exceeds that of normal faults. All tension fractures and normal faults are vertical at the surface, indicating that the surface parts were generated by an absolute tension. In addition to a fissure swarm, many volcanic systems have a central volcano some of which have developed collapse calderas. In the late Tertiary and Pleistocene lava pile of Iceland, extinct volcanic systems are represented by local sheet swarms and regional dyke swarms. The sheet swarms are normally circular or slightly elliptical, several kilometres in radius, and are confined to the extinct central volcanoes. Many swarms are associated with large plutons, exposed at 1-2 km depth beneath the initial top of the rift zone and presumably the uppermost parts of extinct crustal magma chambers, and in short traverses up to 90\% of the rock may consist of sheets. The sheets have a very variable strike, dip on average 45-65 degrees, mostly towards the centre of the associated volcano, and have an average thickness of about 1 m. The regional dykes occur outside central volcanoes in swarms that are commonly 50 km long and 5-10 km wide. In several-kilometre-long traverses, commonly 1-5\% of the rock consist of dykes but occasionally as much as 15-28\%. Most regional dykes are subparallel and subvertical. The average dyke thickness in the Pleistocene swarms is less than 2 m but 4-6 m in the Tertiary swarms. While active, the volcanic systems in the rift zone are supplied with magma from reservoirs located at the depth of 8-12 km at the boundary between the crust and upper mantle. The reservoirs are partially molten, with totally molten top regions, and of cross-sectional areas similar to those of the volcanic systems that they feed. Some active volcanic systems, especially those that develop central volcanoes, high-temperature areas and calderas, have, in addition to the deep-seated magma reservoirs, shallow crustal magma chambers, located at 1-3 km depth, which, in turn, are fed by the deeper magma reservoirs. It is proposed that the regional dyke swarms are supplied with magma largely from the deep-seated reservoirs, whereas the local sheet swarms are mainly fed from the associated crustal magma chambers. Because the volume of a crustal chamber is less than that of its deeper source reservoir, a single magma flow (dyke intrusion) from the reservoir may trigger tens of magma flows (sheet intrusions) from the chamber, which is one explanation for the enormous number of sheets associated with many central volcanoes. The sheets follow the stress trajectories of the local stress fields around the source chambers, whereas the regional stress field associated with the divergent plate movements controls the emplacement of the regional dykes. It is suggested that many dykes develop as self-affine (some as self-similar) structures. When applied to the Krafla volcanic system in northern Iceland, model calculations suggest that a magma flow from the Krafla reservoir, with regional dyke formation, should occur, on average, once every several hundred years, and that tens of sheets might be injected from the shallow Krafla chamber and triggered by a single magma flow from the Krafla reservoir. These results are in broad agreement with the available data.},

 abstract = {We present dynamically self-consistent mantle-scale laboratory models that have been conducted to improve our understanding of the influence of slab window opening on subduction dynamics, mantle flow and associated dynamic topography over geological time scales. The adopted setup consists of a two-layer linearly viscous system simulating the subduction of a fixed plate of silicone (lithosphere) under negative buoyancy in a viscous layer of glucose syrup (mantle). Our experimental setting is also characterized by a constant-width rectangular window located at the center of a laterally confined slab, modeling the case of the interaction of a trench-parallel spreading ridge with a wide subduction zone. We found that the opening of a slab window does not produce consistent changes of the geometry and the kinematics of the slab. On the contrary, slab-induced mantle circulation, quantified both in the vertical and horizontal sections using the Feature Tracking image analysis technique, is strongly modified. In particular, rollback subduction and the opening of the slab window generate a complex mantle circulation pattern characterized by the presence of poloidal and toroidal components, with the importance of each evolving according to kinematic stages. Mantle coming from the oceanic domain floods through the slab window, indenting the supra-slab mantle zone and producing its deformation without any mixing between mantle portions. The opening of the slab window and the upwelling of sub-slab mantle produce a regional-scale non-isostatic topographic uplift of the overriding plate that would correspond to values ranging between ca 1 and 5 km in nature. Assuming that our modeling results can be representative of the natural behavior of subduction zones, we compared them to the tectonics and volcanism of the Patagonian subduction zone. We found that the anomalous backarc volcanism that has been developing since the middle Miocene could result from the lateral flow of sub-slab mantle and that part of the Patagonian uplift could be dynamically supported. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

 abstract = {Clementine color (ultraviolet, visible or UVVIS) and Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) Wide Angle (WAC) and Narrow Angle (NAC) camera data provide the means to investigate localized lunar dark-mantle deposits (DMDs) of potential pyroclastic origin. Our goals are to (1) examine the morphology and physical characteristics of these deposits with LROC WAC and NAC data; (2) extend methods used in earlier studies of lunar DMDs with Clementine spectral reflectance (CSR) data; (3) use LRO WAC multispectral data to complement and extend the CSR data for compositional analyses; and (4) apply these results to identify the likely mode of emplacement and study the diversity of compositions among these deposits. Pyroclastic deposits have been recognized all across the Moon, identified by their low albedo, smooth texture, and mantling relationship to underlying features. Gaddis et al. (2003) presented a compositional analysis of 75 potential lunar pyroclastic deposits (LPDs) based on CSR measurements. New LRO camera (LROC) data permit more extensive analyses of such deposits than previously possible. Our study began with six sites on the southeastern limb of the Moon that contain nine of the cataloged 75 potential pyroclastic deposits: Humboldt (4 deposits), Petavius, Barnard, Abel B, Abel C, and Titius. Our analysis found that some of the DMDs exhibit qualities characteristic of fluid emplacement, such as flat surfaces, sharp margins, embaying relationships, and flow textures. We conclude that the localized DMDs are a complex class of features, many of which may have formed by a combination of effusive and pyroclastic emplacement mechanisms. We have extended this analysis to include additional localized DMDs from the catalog of 75 potential pyroclastic deposits. We have examined high resolution (up to 0.5 m/p) NAC images as they become available to assess the mode of emplacement of the deposits, locate potential volcanic vents, and assess physical characteristics of the DMDs such as thickness, roughness, and rock abundance. Within and around each DMD, the Clementine UVVIS multispectral mosaic (100 m/p, 5 bands at 415, 750, 900, 950, and 1000 nm) and LROC WAC multispectral image cubes (75 to 400 m/p, 7 bands at 320, 360, 415, 565, 605, 645, and 690 nm) have been used to extract spectral reflectance data. Spectral ratio plots were prepared to compare deposits and draw conclusions regarding compositional differences, such as mafic mineral or titanium content and distribution, both within and between DMDs. The result of the study will be an improved classification of these deposits in terms of emplacement mechanisms and composition, including identifying compositional affinities among DMDs and between DMDs and other volcanic deposits.},

 abstract = {Chemostratigraphy has diverse applications to investigating the rock record, such as reconstructing paleoenvironments, determining the tectonic setting of sedimentary basins, indirect dating, and establishing regional or global correlations. Chemostratigraphy is thus an integral component of many investigations of the ancient sedimentary record. In this contribution, we review the principle inorganic geochemical methods that have been applied to the Neoproterozoic sedimentary record. Analysis of the traditional stable and radiogenic isotope systems, such as ␦13C, ␦18O, ␦34S, and 87Sr/86Sr, is routine, particularly in successions rich in carbonate. These mainstay applications have yielded invaluable data and information bearing on the chronology and evolution of this eventful era in Earth history. Alongside the growing database of traditional data, a series of novel geochemical techniques have given rise to important new models and constraints on Neoproterozoic biogeochemical change. In particular, a range of proxies for water column redox, mainly obtained from black shales, have shed light on the pace and tempo of Neoproterozoic oxygenation and its link to the appearance of early animal evolution. Increased integration of diverse geochemical, sedimentological, and paleontological datasets, and the gradual radiometric calibration of the stratigraphic record promise to bring the details of the evolution of the Neoproterozoic Earth system into ever greater focus.},

 abstract = {Broadband seismic data from the United States were processed into Ps and Sp receiver function image volumes for the purpose of constraining negative velocity gradients (NVG) at depths between the Moho and 200 km. Moho depth picks from the two independent datasets are in good agreement, however, large discrepancies in NVG picks occur and are attributed to free-surface multiples which obscure deep NVG arrivals in the Ps data. From the Sp data, shallow NVG are found west of the Rockies and in the central US while deep and sporadic NVG are observed beneath the Great Plains and northern Rockies. To aid the interpretation of the observed NVG arrivals, the mantle thermal field is estimated by mapping surface wave tomography velocities to temperature assuming an anelastic olivine model. The distribution of temperature versus NVG depth is bi-modal and displays two distinct thermal populations that are interpreted to represent both the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB) and mid-lithosphere discontinuities (MLD). LAB arrivals occur in the western US at 60-85 km and 1200-1400??C depth suggesting that they manifest partial melt near the base of the thermal plate. MLD arrivals primarily occur at 70-110 km depth and 700-900??C and we hypothesize that these arrivals are caused by a low-velocity metasomatic layer containing phlogopite resulting from magma crystallization products that accumulate within long-lived thick lithosphere.},

@article{Hanson2006,
 abstract = {The Kalahari Craton was initially stabilized following cessation of Palaeoproterozoic orogenesis in southern Africa at ca. 1.8 Ga. Subsequent Mesoproterozoic intraplate magmatism at ca. 1.4–1.35 Ga formed a series of alkaline and carbonatitic complexes in the southern part of the craton. Original volcanic structures are partly preserved in some of the complexes, and a variety of intrusive rocks (e.g., quartz syenite, nepheline syenite, pyroxenite, ijolite, carbonatite) are present. The Premier kimberlite cluster was emplaced in the same region at ca. 1.2 Ga, but available geochronology indicates that the main alkaline magmatism preceded 1.2–1.0 Ga orogenesis in the Namaqua–Natal–Maud Belt along the southern craton margin. Another, more extensive intraplate magmatic event at ca. 1.1 Ga formed the Umkondo Igneous Province, which is recognized over an area of \$2.0 · 106 km2 on the Kalahari Craton, including a detached fragment now located in Antarctica. Much of the province comprises high-level maﬁc intrusions, but erosional remnants of basalt lava piles and bimodal basalt/rhyolite assemblages are also present. Most of the maﬁc rocks are continental tholeiites, but trace-element geochemistry reveals distinct subgroups that cannot be related by crustal-level assimilation/fractional crystallization processes or by partial melting of a uniform mantle source. Geochronological and palaeomagnetic data indicate that enormous volumes of tholeiitic magma were emplaced within the province in a narrow time frame at ca. 1112–1106 Ma, which is inferred to record uprise of a mantle plume behind the Namaqua–Natal–Maud Belt.},

 abstract = {I present and interpret new earthquake relocations and focal mechanisms for the California Central Coast. The relocations improve upon catalog locations by using 3D seismic velocity models to account for lateral variations in structure and by using relative arrival times from waveform cross-correlation and double-difference methods to image seismicity features more sharply. Focal mechanisms are computed using ray tracing in the 3D velocity models. Seismicity alignments on the Hosgri fault confirm that it is vertical down to at least 12 km depth, and the focal mechanisms are consistent with right-lateral strike-slip motion on a vertical fault. A prominent, newly observed feature is an similar to 25 km long linear trend of seismicity running just offshore and parallel to the coastline in the region of Point Buchon, informally named the Shoreline fault. This seismicity trend is accompanied by a linear magnetic anomaly, and both the seismicity and the magnetic anomaly end where they obliquely meet the Hosgri fault. Focal mechanisms indicate that the Shoreline fault is a vertical strike-slip fault. Several seismicity lineations with vertical strike-slip mechanisms are observed in Estero Bay. Events greater than about 10 km depth in Estero Bay, however, exhibit reverse-faulting mechanisms, perhaps reflecting slip at the top of the remnant subducted slab. Strike-slip mechanisms are observed offshore along the Hosgri-San Simeon fault system and onshore along the West Huasna and Rinconada faults, while reverse mechanisms are generally confined to the region between these two systems. This suggests a model in which the reverse faulting is primarily due to restraining left-transfer of right-lateral slip.},

@article{Harrison2013,
 abstract = {The Medusae Fossae Formation (MFF) is a geological formation comprising three geological units (members) spread across five principal lobes. It dominates a quarter of the longitudinal extent of the equatorial region of Mars. Positive relief features referred to as 'sinuous ridges' (commonly interpreted as inverted paleoflow channel or valley fills) have been observed in the lowest member of the western MFF, but have not been identified within the central and eastern portions of the formation, in the middle and upper members. This paper presents the identification and analysis of a branching, positive relief system which occurs in the central lobe of the MFF in what appears to be an exposure of the middle member. A simple geomorphological map of the system is presented, from which we have adopted the working hypothesis that this is an inverted fill of a branching fluvial channel or valley system. A suite of morphological and topographic evidence supporting this hypothesis is presented, including analysis of the network using a ∼15 m/pixel digital terrain model derived from a Context Imager (CTX) stereo image pair. The evidence supporting this hypothesis includes: (1) the local slope and topography of the upper surface of the network are consistent with a contributory network; (2) the braided, fan-like form at the termination of the branching network is consistent in morphology with it being a depositional fan at the end of a fluvial system; (3) the terminal fan and surrounding deposits show layering and polygonization; and (4) there is strong association between the lower order branches and amphitheater shaped scarps in the depression walls. We evaluate the possible origins of this fluvial system and suggest that seepage sapping is the most probable. Two possible models for the evolution of the network and related features are presented; both require melt of ice within the MFF to form liquid water. We conclude that at least some portions of the Medusae Fossae Formation, if not the entire formation, were once volatile-rich. Finally, we note that our observations do not rule out the case that this network formed before MFF emplacement, and has since been exhumed. However, this conclusion would suggest that much of the surrounding terrain, currently mapped as middle-member MFF, is not in fact MFF material at all. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

 abstract = {The “cones method” is an analytical algorithm to combine a pair of separate angle observations into a common vector. Two new algorithms have been developed to determine optimum “cones method” solutions when more than two observation angles and estimates of their measurement uncertainties are available. The polycones algorithm consists of determining a simple weighted average of the solution vectors over all possible pairs of measurements with the weights determined from the measurement uncertainty. The Fuzzycones method finds the vector of maximum probability consistent with the measurements and their uncertainties. Both of these methods have been implemented and tested by comparison with simulations of a coarse Sun sensor and attitudes determined for a simulated spinning spacecraft. Compared to the cones method, both algorithms reduce angle errors somewhat for simulated Sun sensors. For the simulated spacecraft, attitude determination with Fuzzycones gives results almost identical to those for the cones method while Polycones gives significantly worse results with the current weighting method.},

 abstract = {A compilation of data on volumes and masses of evaporite deposits is used as the basis for reconstruction of the salinity of the ocean in the past. Chloride is tracked as the only ion essentially restricted to the ocean, and past salinities are calculated from reconstructed chlorine content of the ocean. Models for ocean salinity through the Phanerozoic are developed using maximal and minimal estimates of the volumes of existing evaporite deposits, and using constant and declining volumes of ocean water through the Phanerozoic. We conclude that there have been significant changes in the mean salinity of the ocean accompanying a general decline throughout the Phanerozoic. The greatest changes are related to major extractions of salt into the young ocean basins which developed during the Mesozoic as Pangaea broke apart. Unfortunately, the sizes of these salt deposits are also the least well known. The last major extractions of salt from the ocean occurred during the Miocene, shortly after the large scale extraction of water from the ocean to form the ice cap of Antarctica. However, these two modifications of the masses of H2O and salt in the ocean followed in sequence and did not cancel each other out. Accordingly, salinities during the Early Miocene were between 37‰ and 39‰. The Mesozoic was a time of generally declining salinity associated with the deep sea salt extractions of the North Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico (Middle to Late Jurassic) and South Atlantic (Early Cretaceous). The earliest of the major extractions of the Phanerozoic occurred during the Permian. There were few large extractions of salt during the earlier Palaeozoic. The models suggest that this was a time of relatively stable but slowly increasing salinities ranging through the upper 40‰'s into the lower 50‰'s. Higher salinities for the world ocean have profound consequences for the thermohaline circulation of the ocean in the past. In the modern ocean, with an average salinity of about 34.7‰, the density of water is only very slightly affected by cooling as it approaches the freezing point. Consequently, salinization through sea-ice formation or evaporation is usually required to make water dense enough to sink into the ocean interior. At salinities above about 40‰ water continues to become more dense as it approaches the freezing point, and salinization is not required. The energy-consuming phase changes involved in sea-ice formation and evaporation would not be required for vertical circulation in the ocean. The hypothesized major declines in salinity correspond closely to the evolution of both planktonic foraminifera and calcareous nannoplankton. Both groups were restricted to shelf regions in the Jurassic and early Cretaceous, but spread into the open ocean in the mid-Cretaceous. Their availability to inhabit the open ocean may be directly related to the decline in salinity. The Permian extraction may have created stress for marine organisms and may have been a factor contributing to the end-Permian extinction. The modeling also suggests that there was a major salinity decline from the Late Precambrian to the Cambrian, and it is tempting to speculate that this may have been a factor in the Cambrian explosion of life. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

 abstract = {Outcrop exposures imaged by the Opportunity rover at Victoria Crater, a 750 m diameter crater in Meridiani Planum, are used to delineate sedimentary structures and further develop a dune?interdune depositional model for the region. The stratigraphy at Victoria Crater, observed during Opportunity's partial traverse of its rim, includes the best examples of meter?scale eolian cross bedding observed on Mars to date. The Cape St. Mary promontory, located at the southern end of the rim traverse, is characterized by meter?scale sets of trough cross bedding, suggesting northward migrating sinuous?crested bed forms. Cape St. Vincent, which is located at the opposite end of the traverse, shows tabular?planar stratification indicative of climbing bed forms with meter? to decameter?scale dune heights migrating southward. Promontories located between Cape St. Mary and Cape St. Vincent contain superposed stratigraphic units with northward and southward dipping beds separated by outcrop?scale bounding surfaces. These bounding surfaces are interpreted to be either reactivation and/or superposition surfaces in a complex erg sea. Any depositional model used to explain the bedding must conform to reversing northward and southward paleomigration directions and include multiple scales of bed forms. In addition to stratified outcrop, a bright diagenetic band is observed to overprint bedding and to lie on an equipotential parallel to the preimpact surface. Meter?scale cross bedding at Victoria Crater is similar to terrestrial eolian deposits and is interpreted as a dry dune field, comparable to Jurassic age eolian deposits in the western United States.},

 abstract = {The South Atlantic rift basin evolved as a branch of a large Jurassic-Cretaceous intraplate rift zone between the African and South American plates during the final break-up of western Gondwana. While the relative motions between South America and Africa for post-break-up times are well resolved, many issues pertaining to the fit reconstruction and particularly the relation between kinematics and lithosphere dynamics during pre-break-up remain unclear in currently published plate models. We have compiled and assimilated data from these intraplated rifts and constructed a revised plate kinematic model for the pre-break-up evolution of the South Atlantic. Based on structural restoration of the conjugate South Atlantic margins and intracontinental rift basins in Africa and South America, we achieve a tight-fit reconstruction which eliminates the need for previously inferred large intracontinental shear zones, in particular in Patagonian South America. By quantitatively accounting for crustal deformation in the Central and West African Rift Zones, we have been able to indirectly construct the kinematic history of the pre-break-up evolution of the conjugate west African-Brazilian margins. Our model suggests a causal link between changes in extension direction and velocity during continental extension and the generation of marginal structures such as the enigmatic presalt sag basin and the São Paulo High. We model an initial E-W-directed extension between South America and Africa (fixed in present-day position) at very low extensional velocities from 140Ma until late Hauterivian times (≈ 126 Ma) when rift activity along in the equatorial Atlantic domain started to increase significantly. During this initial ≈ 14 Myrlong stretching episode the pre-salt basin width on the conjugate Brazilian and west African margins is generated. An intermediate stage between ≈ 126 Ma and base Aptian is characterised by strain localisation, rapid lithospheric weakening in the equatorial Atlantic domain, resulting in both progressively increasing extensional velocities as well as a significant rotation of the extension direction to NE-SW. From base Aptian onwards diachronous lithospheric breakup occurred along the central South Atlantic rift, first in the Sergipe-Alagoas/Rio Muni margin segment in the northernmost South Atlantic. Final break-up between South America and Africa occurred in the conjugate Santos-Benguela margin segment at around 113 Ma and in the equatorial Atlantic domain between the Ghanaian Ridge and the Piaúi-Ceará margin at 103 Ma. We conclude that such a multi-velocity, multi-directional rift history exerts primary control on the evolution of these conjugate passive-margin systems and can explain the first-order tectonic structures along the South Atlantic and possibly other passive margins.

 abstract = {Rifting between large continental plates results in either continental breakup and the for- mation of conjugate passive margins, or rift abandonment and a set of aborted rift basins. The nonlinear interaction between key parameters such as plate boundary confi guration, litho- spheric architecture, and extension geometry determines the dynamics of rift evolution and ultimately selects between successful or failed rifts. In an attempt to evaluate and quantify the contribution of the rift geometry, we analyze the Early Cretaceous extension between Africa and South America that was preceded by ̃20–30 m.y. of extensive intracontinental rifting prior to the fi nal separation between the two plates. While the South Atlantic and Equato- rial Atlantic conjugate passive margins continued into seafl oor-spreading mode, forming the South Atlantic Ocean basin, Cretaceous African intraplate rifts eventually failed soon after South America broke away from Africa. We investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics of rifting in these domains through a joint plate kinematic and three-dimensional forward numerical modeling approach, addressing (1) the dynamic competition of Atlantic and Afri- can extensional systems, (2) two-stage kinematics of the South Atlantic Rift System, and (3) the acceleration of the South America plate prior to fi nal breakup. Oblique rifts are mechanically favored because they require both less strain and less force in order to reach the plastic yield limit. This implies that rift obliquity can act as selector between successful ocean basin forma- tion and failed rifts, explaining the success of the highly oblique Equatorial Atlantic rift and ultimately inhibiting the formation of a Saharan Atlantic Ocean. We suggest that thinning of the last continental connection between Africa and South America produced a severe strength- velocity feedback responsible for the observed increase in South America plate velocity.},

@article{Herman2010,
 abstract = {Two end-member kinematic models of crustal shortening across the Himalaya are currently debated: one assumes localized thrusting along a single major thrust fault, the Main Himalayan Thrust (MHT) with nonuniform underplating due to duplexing, and the other advocates for out-of-sequence (OOS) thrusting in addition to thrusting along the MHT and underplating. We assess these two models based on the modeling of thermochronological, thermometric, and thermobarometric data from the central Nepal Himalaya. We complement a data set compiled from the literature with 114 40Ar/39Ar, 10 apatite fission track, and 5 zircon (U-Th)/He thermochronological data. The data are predicted using a thermokinematic model (PECUBE), and the model parameters are constrained using an inverse approach based on the Neighborhood Algorithm. The model parameters include geometric characteristics as well as overthrusting rates, radiogenic heat production in the High Himalayan Crystalline (HHC) sequence, the age of initiation of the duplex or of out-of-sequence thrusting. Both models can provide a satisfactory fit to the inverted data. However, the model with out-of-sequence thrusting implies an unrealistic convergence rate ≥30 mm yr−1. The out-of-sequence thrust model can be adjusted to fit the convergence rate and the thermochronological data if the Main Central Thrust zone is assigned a constant geometry and a dip angle of about 30° and a slip rate of 1 mm yr−1. In the duplex model, the 20 mm yr−1 convergence rate is partitioned between an overthrusting rate of 5.8 ± 1.4 mm yr−1 and an underthrusting rate of 14.2 ± 1.8 mm yr−1. Modern rock uplift rates are estimated to increase from about 0.9 ± 0.31 mm yr−1 in the Lesser Himalaya to 3.0 ± 0.9 mm yr−1 at the front of the high range, 86 ± 13 km from the Main Frontal Thrust. The effective friction coefficient is estimated to be 0.07 or smaller, and the radiogenic heat production of HHC units is estimated to be 2.2 ± 0.1 μW m−3. The midcrustal duplex initiated at 9.8 ± 1.7 Ma, leading to an increase of uplift rate at front of the High Himalaya from 0.9 ± 0.31 to 3.05 ± 0.9 mm yr−1. We also run 3-D models by coupling PECUBE with a landscape evolution model (CASCADE). This modeling shows that the effect of the evolving topography can explain a fraction of the scatter observed in the data but not all of it, suggesting that lateral variations of the kinematics of crustal deformation and exhumation are likely. It has been argued that the steep physiographic transition at the foot of the Greater Himalayan Sequence indicates OOS thrusting, but our results demonstrate that the best fit duplex model derived from the thermochronological and thermobarometric data reproduces the present morphology of the Nepal Himalaya equally well.},

 abstract = {Detrital white micas from molasse sediments of the Nama Group were dated by the K/Ar method. The Kuibis Subgroup and the underlying pre-Damara Sinclair Sequence contain detrital muscovite with ages of 1100-1000 Ma and thus cannot be derived from the Damara Orogen, but prove to have originated from a basement probably affected by the Kibaran orogeny. Muscovite size-fractions of 250-100 [mu]m from the upper Nama Group (upper Schwarzrand and Fish River Subgroups) yielded K/Ar ages 670-570 Ma. Because these sediments are regarded as molasse series of the Damara Orogen, these K/Ar ages can be interpreted as cooling ages of a first, early tectono-thermal event in the Damara Orogen. A later Damaran metamorphic overprint, which peaked at about 530 Ma, is not documented in the detrital content of the Nama Group at the present level of erosion, because detrital micas with K/Ar ages over 600 Ma, have been found up to the uppermost Fish River Subgroup. It can be concluded that, at least, two tectono-metamorphic events followed by uplift and erosion, have taken place during the development of the Damara Orogen. Thermal alterations of the Nama sediments were detected by means of illite crystallinity and K/Ar dating of clay size-fractions. These data, as well as the almost exclusive occurrence of the 2M mica polytype in these size-fractions point to a diagenetic to very low grade metamorphic alteration of the area investigated at about 530-500 Ma and younger. The deposition of the upper Nama Group is younger than the 570 Ma detrital white micas but occurred before the 530-500 Ma thermal alteration of the Nama deposits. The deposition of the lower Nama Group probably took place between 635 and 570 Ma.},

 abstract = {The major topographic features of the martian polar layered deposits include the conspicuous spiral troughs, subtle undulations, broad reentrants (chasma), steep, arcuate scarps, and dune fields. A prominent role for eolian processes in the formation of all of these features is proposed. Strong katabatic winds occur on the north polar cap, producing widespread frost streaks. These cold drainage winds are analogous to those on the terrestrial Antarctic cap. In the chasmae convergent katabatic winds create yardangs and erode arcuate scarps in the layered deposits that are also the source for local dune fields migrating outward from the polar cap. The chasmae are postulated to originate by long-term erosion by katabatic wind. Wind plays a role in formation of the troughs and scarps primarily through removal of dust freed from exposed layered deposits by ablation of ice on defrosted equator-facing slopes. The undulations are created by interaction between surface erosion or deposition of perennial ice and standing waves in the shallow katabatic windflow. The south polar layered deposits exhibit topographic features similar to those at the north polar cap, but erosion and depositional processes creating these features may be inactive during the current epoch because of the lack of an extensive perennial ice cover and associated katabatic wind.},

 abstract = {A prominent subbottom reflector (M- in the Mediterranean and S- in the Red Sea) has been identified by deep sea drilling as the top of an Upper Miocene evaporite formation. The Mediterranean evaporite minerals are dolomite, gypsum, anhydrite, halite, polyhalite, kainite, sulphoborite, possibly bishofite and lunebergite, a borate and phosphate mineral. The Red Sea evaporite minerals include dolomite, magnesite, gypsum, anhydrite, halite, polyhalite, and possibly tachyhydrite. Analcite and length-slow chalcedony are present locally in both regions, probably as diagenetic minerals. The sedimentary structures of the evaporites from both regions indicate a genesis in sabkha environments. The bromine profiles of the halites are also typical of deposition in shallow brine-pools. On the other hand, the sediments immediately below and above the evaporite in the Mediterranean, and those immediately above the evaporite in the Red Sea are typically hemipelagic marls, containing deep-water benthonic fossils. We believe, therefore, that the evaporites were deposited in pre-existing deep basins, and that the evaporites, at least those from the intervals penetrated by deep sea drilling, were deposited after the basins were partially or wholly desiccated. Isotopic analyses of the carbonates and of the interstitial waters from the evaporites suggest considerable freshwater influx into the desiccating basins. That the Messinian basins were host to fresh or brackish water lakes is further proven by the occurrence of a Paratethys ostracod-fauna and an epiphytic diatom-flora in the upper levels of the Mediterranean evaporites. While the Red Sea might have received its freshwater supply from African rivers, the eastern Mediterranean lac mer with its Cyprideis pannonica, might have been a part of the Paratethys, which was a great brackish water body extending from Vienna Basin to Aral Sea. The stratigraphy of the evaporites under the Red Sea is remarkably similar to that under central Ionian abyssal plain (Site 374). A dark gray, dolomitic marl (or mud) unit is present between an anhydrite-halite unit of Late Messinian and a normal marine hemipelagic marl of Pliocene age. The dolomitic sediment is largely unfossiliferous except for some nannofossils (latest Miocene or earliest Pliocene) and it may represent a more euxinic, or more basinal equivalent of Upper Messinian Cyprideis-bearing beds elsewhere (e.g. Florence Ridge, Sites 375-376). The simultaneous occurrence of an evaporite by desiccation during the latest Miocene and the simultaneous submergence under normal marine waters during the earliest Pliocene suggest that the Mediterranean and the Red Sea Basins were parts of one and the same hydrographic system. As the Mediterranean is demonstrably an Atlantic province during the Mio-Pliocene, we suspect that the Red Sea was not connected with the Indian Ocean when its evaporites were being formed. The Strait of Bab el Mandeb was opened during a more recent episode of seafloor spreading. This event, together with an isolation from the Mediterranean by the Isthmus of Suez, rendered the Red Sea an appendix of the Indian Ocean. © 1978.},

 abstract = {On 17 August 1999, a destructive magnitude 7.4 earthquake occurred 100 km east of Istanbul, near the city of Izmit, on the North Anatolian fault. This 1,600-km-long plate boundary slips at an average rate of 2-3 cm yr(-1), and historically has been the site of many devastating earthquakes. This century alone it has ruptured over 900 km of its length. Models of earthquake-induced stress change combined with active fault maps had been used to forecast that the epicentral area of the 1999 Izmit event was indeed a likely location for the occurrence of a large earthquake. Here we show that the 1999 event itself significantly modifies the stress distribution resulting from previous fault interactions. Our new stress models take into account all events in the region with magnitudes greater than 6 having occurred since 1700 as well as secular interseismic stress change, constrained by GPS data. These models provide a consistent picture of the long term spatio-temporal behaviour of the North Anatolian fault and indicate that two events of magnitude equal to, or greater than, the Izmit earthquake are likely to occur within the next decades beneath the Marmara Sea, south of Istanbul.},

 abstract = {We evaluated the initial 12 months of vegetation index product availability from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on board the Earth Observing System-Terra platform. Two MODIS vegetation indices (VI), the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI), are produced at 1-km and 500-m resolutions and 16-day compositing periods. This paper presents an initial analysis of the MODIS NDVI and EVI performance from both radiometric and biophysical perspectives. We utilize a combination of site-intensive and regionally extensive approaches to demonstrate the performance and validity of the two indices. Our results showed a good correspondence between airborne-measured, top-of-canopy reflectances and VI values with those from the MODIS sensor at four intensively measured test sites representing semi-arid grass/shrub, savanna, and tropical forest biomes. Simultaneously derived field biophysical measures also demonstrated the scientific utility of the MODIS VI. Multitemporal profiles of the MODIS VIs over numerous biome types in North and South America well represented their seasonal phenologies. Comparisons of the MODIS-NDVI with the NOAA-14, 1-km AVHRR-NDVI temporal profiles showed that the MODIS-based index performed with higher fidelity. The dynamic range of the MODIS VIs are presented and their sensitivities in discriminating vegetation differences are evaluated in sparse and dense vegetation areas. We found the NDVI to asymptotically saturate in high biomass regions such as in the Amazon while the EVI remained sensitive to canopy variations. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.},

@article{Humphreys1995,
 abstract = {I propose that post-Laramide removal of the subhorizontally subducting Farallon slab occurred by buckling downward along an approximately east-northeast–trending axis. This process was accomplished by a tearing or necking separation of the subducted slab near the northern and southern boundaries of the United States and propagation of the separated edges toward the central axis of downwelling, accompanied by aesthenosphic upwelling behind the trailing edges. Initial buckling probably began near 50 Ma, and slab removal was complete by 20 Ma. This model is based primarily on the space-time evolution of the ‘‘ignimbrite flare-up'' (a major midTertiary igneous event of mantle origin), which involved two propagating fronts of initiation of volcanism that followed the proposed motions of the separated slab edges as they converged on central Nevada from the north and southeast. Post-Laramide uplift, extension, establishment of the Cascadia subduction zone, and active magmatism may be consequences of lithosphere-scale modifications caused by the Laramide removal of the slab and the resulting asthenospheric upwelling.},

@article{Husson2015,
 abstract = {The most negative carbon isotope excursion in Earth history is found in carbonate rocks of the Ediacaran Period (635-541 Ma). Known colloquially as the " Shuram " excursion, workers have long noted its broad concordance with the rise of abundant macro-scale fossils in the rock record, collectively known as the " Ediacaran Biota. " Thus, the Shuram excursion has been interpreted by many in the context of a dramatically changing redox state of the Ediacaran oceans—for example, a result of methane cycling in a low O 2 atmosphere, the final destruction of a large pool of recalcitrant dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and the step-wise oxidation of the Ediacaran oceans. More recently, diagenetic interpretations of the Shuram excursion have challenged the various redox models, with the very negative ␦ 13 C values of Ediacaran carbonates explained via sedimentary in-growth of very ␦ 13 C depleted authigenic carbonates, meteoric alteration or late-stage burial diagenesis. A strati-graphic and sedimentological context is required to discriminate between these explanatory models, and to determine whether the Shuram excursion can be used to evaluate oxygenation in terminal Neoproterozoic oceans. Here we present chemo-stratigraphic data (␦ 13 C, ␦ 18 O, and trace element abundances) from 15 measured sections of the Ediacaran-aged Wonoka Formation (Fm.) of South Australia. In some locations, the Wonoka Fm. is ϳ700 meters (m) of mixed shelf limestones and siliciclastics that record a 17 permil ␦ 13 C excursion (؊12 to ؉5‰). Further north in the basin, the Wonoka Fm. is host to deep (ϳ1 km) paleocanyons, which are partly filled by tabular-clast carbonate breccias. Canyon-filling ceased during ongoing sedimen-tation on the shelf interior (the " canyon-shoulder "), as evidenced by upper canyon-shoulder units that overlie and cap certain canyon-fill sequences. The unprecedented size of the chemostratigraphic dataset presented here (2671 ␦ 13 C-␦ 18 O measurements from the canyon-shoulder, 1393 ␦ 13 C-␦ 18 O measurements from canyon clasts, and 11 different trace elements measured on 247 Wonoka Fm. carbonate samples), when coupled with the unique canyon-shoulder to canyon-fill depositional system of the Wonoka Fm., allows for new insights into Ediacaran carbon isotope systematics. The excursion is preserved in a remarkably consistent fashion across 12,000 km 2 of basin area; fabric-altering diagenesis, where present, occurs at the sub-meter vertical scale, results in  1 permil offsets in ␦ 13 C and cannot be used to explain the full ␦ 13 C excursion. Multi-variate analysis of the dataset allows for rigorous assessment of different potential carbonate sources for the Wonoka canyon-fill breccias. Eroded and transported canyon-shoulder carbonates are the most likely source, thus requiring a syn-depositional age for the extraordinary range of ␦ 13 C values (؊12 to ؉5‰) observed in both the Wonoka Fm. canyon-shoulder and canyon-fill breccias. Geological 1 observations (for example, excellent preservation of sedimentary structures in Wo-noka carbonates, absence of top-down alteration profiles associated with exposure surfaces) do not provide first-order evidence for the meteoric or authigenic carbonate models. Thus, the balance of evidence supports either a primary origin or syn-depositional, fabric-retentive diagenesis for the deep negative ␦ 13 C excursion hosted in the Wonoka Formation of South Australia.},

 abstract = {Large exposures of water-altered layered deposits have recently been identified on the surface of Mars. The source materials, formation, and aqueous alteration history are presently poorly understood. The Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity has examined a tiny fraction of large-scale layered deposits in Meridiani Planum, and many questions remain about the origin and history of these widespread materials. Here we present the first detailed stratigraphic study of sulfate-bearing layers throughout the region. We used altimetry data to examine the three-dimensional disposition of twenty-two distinct stratigraphic horizons along their exposures. Our results show that most of these benchmark horizons: (1) are planar and coherent over at least a 100-km scale, and (2) have dip azimuth and magnitudes that are similar to the underlying regional slope, which was emplaced by 3.70??Ga. Nearby ancient river valleys, that appear to have been formed by precipitation-fed surface runoff, originally were incised at ̃ 3.74??Ga and then reactivated near the Noachian-Hesperian boundary (3.70??Ga). Mapping relations with these valleys suggest that the Meridiani layers formed near and after this time and without significant volumetric contributions of material excavated from the valleys. Thermal infrared data and erosional expressions imply that significant physical compositional differences exist within the stratigraphy, and these likely reflect a changing paleodepositional environment and/or chemical alteration histories. Any hypothesis for the origin of these regional-scale materials must be consistent with all these observations. We conclude that the previously stated hypotheses of aeolian deposition cemented by a fluxing groundwater table and sulfur-rich volcanic processes are both viable possibilities, while other hypotheses are not supported by these observations. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

 abstract = {The variation of permeability with depth can be probed indirectly by various means, including hydrologic models that use geothermal data as constraints and the progress of metamorphic reactions driven by fluid flow. Geothermal and metamorphic data combine to indicate that mean permeability (k) of tectonically active continental crust decreases with depth (z) according to log k )14–3.2 log z, where k is in m2 and z in km. Other independently derived, crustal-scale k–z relations are generally similar to this power-law curve. Yet there is also substantial evidence for local-to-regional-scale, transient, permeability-generation events that entail permeabilities much higher than these mean k–z relations would suggest. Compilation of such data yields a fit to these elevated, transient values of log k )11.5–3.2 log z, suggesting a functional form similar to that of tectonically active crust, but shifted to higher permeability at a given depth. In addition, it seems possible that, in the absence of active prograde metamorphism, permeability in the deeper crust will decay toward values below the mean k–z curves. Several lines of evidence suggest geologically rapid (years to 103 years) decay of high-permeability transients toward background values. Crustal-scale k–z curves may reflect a dynamic competition between permeability creation by processes such as fluid sourcing and rock failure, and permeability destruction by processes such as compaction, hydrothermal alteration, and retrograde metamorphism.},

 abstract = {We have mapped the area of Isidis Planitia (1-27??N, 75-103??E) in order to assess the geologic history of this region using modern data sets such as MOLA topography and the high-resolution images provided by the HRSC, CTX, and HiRISE cameras. Results of our mapping show that the geologic history of Isidis Planitia consists of three principal episodes. (1) Impact dominated episode (Noachian, until ̃3.8Ga): During this time, the oldest materials in the study area were formed mostly by impact reworking and mass-wasting. Other processes (e.g., volcanism and fluvial/glacial activity) likely operated at this time but played a subordinate role. (2) An episode related to volcanic and fluvial/glacial activities (late Noachian-early Amazonian, ̃3.8-2.8Ga): Volcanism appears as the most important process at the beginning of this episode (̃3.8-3.5Ga) and was responsible for the formation of a large circum-Isidis volcanic province by the early Hesperian epoch. Volcanic materials covered large portions of the Isidis rim, almost completely buried the previous crater record on the floor of the Isidis basin, and probably were the major contributors to the filling of the basin. Fluvial/glacial processes prevailed closer to the end of the episode (early Hesperian-early Amazonian, ̃3.5-2.8Ga) and were responsible for widespread resurfacing in the Isidis Planitia region, mostly at ̃3.1-3.4Ga. Glaciers and/or ice sheets probably resulted in a massive glaciation of the rim and the floor of the Isidis basin. The total volume of material eroded from the Isidis rim by glacial and fluvial activity is estimated to be about 35,000-50,000km 3, which is equivalent to a composite layer about 40-60m thick on entire floor of the basin. More important, however, is that the eroded materials were likely saturated with ice/water and could form wet deposits on the floor. (3) Wind-dominated episode (since early Amazonian, ̃2.8Ga): Wind activity dominated the later geologic history of Isidis Planitia but resulted only in minor modification of the surface. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Jean2010,
 abstract = {The middle Jurassic Coast Range Ophiolite (CRO) is one of the most important tectonic elements in western California, cropping out as tectonically dismembered elements that extend 700 km from south to north. The volcanic and plutonic sections are commonly interpreted to represent a supra-subduction zone (SSZ) ophiolite, but models specifying a mid-ocean ridge origin have also been proposed. These contrasting interpretations have distinctly different implications for the tectonic evolution of the western Cordillera in the Jurassic. If an SSZ origin is confirmed, we can use the underlying mantle peridotites to elucidate melt processes in the mantle wedge above the subduction zone. This study uses laser ablation–inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry (LA–ICP–MS) to study pyroxenes in peridotites from four mantle sections in the CRO. Trace element signatures of these pyroxenes record magmatic processes characteristic of both mid-ocean ridge and supra-subduction zone settings. Group A clinopyroxene display enriched REE concentrations [e.g., Gd (0.938–1.663 ppm), Dy (1.79–3.24 ppm), Yb (1.216–2.047 ppm), and Lu (0.168–0.290 ppm)], compared to Group B and C clinopyroxenes [e.g., Gd (0.048–0.055 ppm), Dy (0.114–0.225 ppm), Yb (0.128–0.340 ppm), and Lu (0.022–0.05 ppm)]. These patterns are also evident in orthopyroxene. The differences between these geochemical signatures could be a result of a heterogeneous upper mantle or different degrees of partial melting of the upper mantle. It will be shown that CRO peridotites were generated through fractional melting. The shapes of REE patterns are consistent with variable degrees of melting initiated within the garnet stability field. Models call for 3\% dry partial melting of MORB-source asthenosphere in the garnet lherzolite field for abyssal peridotites and 15–20\% further partial melting in the spinel lherzolite field, possibly by hydrous melting for SSZ peridotites. These geochemical variations and occurrence of both styles of melting regimes within close spatial and temporal association suggest that certain segments of the CRO may represent oceanic lithosphere, attached to a large-offset transform fault and that east-dipping, proto-Franciscan subduction may have been initiated along this transform.},

Although one of the earliest multivariate techniques it continues to be the subject of much research, ranging from new model- based approaches to algorithmic ideas from neural networks. It is extremely versatile with applications in many disciplines. The first edition of this book was the first comprehensive text written solely on principal component analysis. The second edition updates and substantially expands the original version, and is once again the definitive text on the subject. It includes core material, current research and a wide range of applications. Its length is nearly double that of the first edition. Researchers in statistics, or in other fields that use principal component analysis, will find that the book gives an authoritative yet accessible account of the subject. It is also a valuable resource for graduate courses in multivariate analysis. The book requires some knowledge of matrix algebra. Ian Jolliffe is Professor of Statistics at the University of Aberdeen. He is author or co-author of over 60 research papers and three other books. His research interests are broad, but aspects of principal component analysis have fascinated him and kept him busy for over 30 years.},

 abstract = {A significant problem in tracking and estimation is the consistent transformation of uncertain state estimates between Cartesian and spherical coordinate systems. For example, a radar system generates measurements in its own local spherical coordinate system. In order to combine those measurements with those from other radars, however, a tracking system typically transforms all measurements to a common Cartesian coordinate system. The most common approach is to approximate the transformation through linearisation. However, this approximation can lead to biases and inconsistencies, especially when the uncertainties on the measurements are large. A number of approaches have been proposed for using higher order transformation models, but these approaches have found only limited use due to the often enormous implementation burdens incurred by the need to derive Jacobians and Hessians. This paper expands a method for nonlinear propagation which is described in a companion paper 3 . A disc...},

A requirement of the O measurement routine described is the use of repetitive statistical analyses of the O standards and subsequent corrections and recalibration. A representative set of O analyses for each spinel population studied is essential to obtain reliable data, and the danger of using single datum is emphasized. Magnesiochromite spinel grains, having broad compositional similarities but different petrogenetic and cooling histories, were analyzed for O and their stoichiometry was assessed. Diamond-indicator spinel from the Aries kimberlite and Argyle lamproite is stoichiometric. Spinel inclusions in olivine phenocrysts from Ti-poor tholeiite from the Hunter Fraction Zone and Ca-rich boninite from the Tonga Trench show a range of nonstoichiometry. High Fe2+/Fe3+ values calculated assuming stoichiometry for such spinel are invalid. Spinel samples from metamorphosed volcanics from the Peak Hill-Glengarry Basin and the Heazlewood River Ultramafic Complex are also nonstoichiometric, having significant Fe8/3O4-Cr8/3O4 components. Our results demonstrate that nonstoichiometry is a common feature of Cr-rich spinel. This has important implications for the use of Fe3+ and Fe2+ concentrations to estimate the oxidation state or temperature of formation.},

 abstract = {Gravity-driven ﬂows on the seaﬂoor are the largest, yet least well understood, sediment transport agents on Earth. Recent exploration wells in ultradeep basins have revealed the presence of large sandy submarine fan systems of enigmatic facies types, many hundreds of kilometers from paleocoastlines. These sedimentary deposits often defy conventional turbidite or debrite interpretations, having a character suggestive of deposition from ﬂows with transient turbulent-laminar rheologies. In the Wilcox Formation (Gulf of Mexico), inferred transitional ﬂow deposits have distinctive stratigraphic stacking patterns, from ﬁne-grained debrites to coarser grained turbidites. The vertical sequence of beds is here inferred to reﬂect the longitudinal bed distribution in response to lobe progradation, and demonstrates a transition from well-mixed turbulent ﬂow, to progressively more rheologically stratiﬁed ﬂow, and eventually to fully laminar ﬂow. The progressive development of internal rheological boundaries resulted in a high-concentration but ﬂuidal basal layer, and an upper quasi-laminar layer with an overriding sheared dilute turbidity current. The long runout of the ﬂows is linked to their high silt and clay content; it is most likely ﬂow expansion at the channel-lobe transition that drives ﬂow transformation. This process-based model may be applicable to many deep-water settings and provides a framework within which to interpret the stratigraphic and spatial distribution of these complex deposits.},

 abstract = {The formation of the Earth's continents is enigmatic. Volcanic arc magmas generated above subduction zones have geochemical compositions that are similar to continental crust, implying that arc magmatic processes played a central role in generating continental crust. Yet the deep crust within volcanic arcs has a very different composition from crust at similar depths beneath the continents. It is therefore unclear how arc crust is transformed into continental crust. The densest parts of arc lower crust may delaminate and become recycled into the underlying mantle. Here we show, however, that even after delamination, arc lower crust still has significantly different trace element contents from continental lower crust. We suggest that it is not delamination that determines the composition of continental crust, but relamination. In our conceptual model, buoyant magmatic rocks generated at arcs are subducted. Then, upon heating at depth, they ascend and are relaminated at the base of the overlying crust. A review of the average compositions of buoyant magmatic rocks [mdash] lavas and plutons [mdash] sampled from the Aleutians, Izu-Bonin-Marianas, Kohistan and Talkeetna arcs reveals that they fall within the range of estimated major and trace elements in lower continental crust. Relamination may thus provide an efficient process for generating lower continental crust.},

 abstract = {The Coast Ranges of the Cascadia margin are overriding the subducted Juan de Fuca/Gorda plate. We investigate the extent to which the latitudinal trend in average topography of the Coast Ranges is a function of the latitudinal change in attributes related to the subduction process. These attributes include the variable age of the subducted slab that underlies the Coast Ranges and average vertical crustal velocities of the western margin of the Coast Ranges for two markedly different time periods, the last 45 years and the last 100 kyr. These vertical crustal velocities are computed from the resurveying of highway bench marks and from the present elevation of shore platforms that have been uplifted in the late Quaternary, respectively. Topography of the Coast Ranges is in part a function of the age and bouyancy of the underlying subducted plate. This is evident in the fact that the two highest topographic elements of the Coast Ranges, the Klamath Mountains and the Olympic Mountains, are underlain by youngest subducted oceanic crust. The subducted Blanco Fracture Zone in southernmost Oregon is responsible for an age discontinuity of subducted crust under the Klamath Mountains. The northern terminus of the topographically higher Klamaths is offset to the north relative to the position of the underlying Blanco Fracture Zone, the offset being in the direction of migration of the fracture zone, as dictated by relative plate motions. Vertical crustal velocities at the coast, derived from bench mark surveys, are as much as an order of magnitude greater than vertical crustal velocities derived from uplifted shore platforms. This uplift rate discrepancy indicates that strain is accumulating on the plate margin, to be released during the next interplate earthquake. In a latitudinal sense, average Coast Range topography is relatively high where bench mark-derived, short-term vertical crustal velocites are highest. Because the shore platform vertical crustal velocites reflect longer-term, permanent uplift, we infer that a small percentage of the interseismic strain that accumulates as rapid short-term uplift is not recovered by subduction earthquakes but rather contributes to rock uplift of the Coast Ranges. The conjecture that permanent rock uplift is related to interseismic uplift is consistent with the observation that those segments of the subduction zone subject to greater interseismic uplift rates are at approximately the same latitudes as those segments of the the Coast Ranges that have higher magnitudes of rock uplift over the long term.},

 abstract = {The Medusae Fossae Formation (MFF), covering about 2.1 ?? 106 km2 (with an estimated volume of 1.4 ?? 106 km3) and straddling the equatorial region of Mars east of Tharsis, has historically been mapped and dated as Amazonian in age. Analysis of the MFF using a range of new observations from recent mission data at multiple resolutions reveals evidence that the formation is older than previously hypothesized, with parts of the MFF having formed in the Hesperian and parts having been reworked and reformed throughout the Amazonian, up to the present. Ancient outcroppings of the MFF, edged with jagged yardangs, became a "mold" for embaying Hesperian-aged lavas. The erosion of the MFF left solidified lava "casts" in the embaying lava unit. This lava edge morphology permits the identification of ancient contacts between the MFF and Hesperian-aged lava terrain. Additionally, the flanking fan of the Hesperian-aged Apollinaris Patera volcano embays the formation at its foot, indicating that parts of the MFF were formed in the Hesperian. Erosion has erased and inverted many of the superposed craters in the region, showing that very young Amazonian ages derived from impact crater size-frequency distributions are resurfacing ages, and not emplacement ages. We find abundant evidence that the formation is extremely mobile and continuously reworked. We conclude that a significant part of the MFF may have originally been emplaced in the Hesperian. These observations place new constraints on the mode of origin of the MFF. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

On the basis of the new formational age, we assess the hypothesis that explosive eruptions from Apollinaris Patera might have been the source of the Medusae Fossae Formation. In order to assess the likelihood of this hypothesis, we examine stratigraphic relationships between Apollinaris Patera and the MFF and analyze the relief of the MFF using topographic data. We predict the areal distribution of tephra erupted from Apollinaris Patera using a Mars Global Circulation Model (GCM) combined with a semi-analytical explosive eruption model for Mars, and compare this with the distribution of the MFF. We conclude that Apollinaris Patera could have been responsible for the emplacement of the Medusae Fossae Formation. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

Indurated TARs are observed to grade into faceted MFF terrain, indicating a genetic relationship between the two. We propose that TAR deposition, induration and erosion have played a larger role in the surface morphology and evolution of the MFF than previously recognized.

 abstract = {Polygonal ridge networks, also known as boxwork or reticulate ridges, are found in numerous locations and geological contexts across Mars. Distinguishing the morphologies and geological context of the ridge networks sheds light on their potential as astrobiological and mineral resource sites of interest. The most widespread type of ridge morphology is characteristic of the Nili Fossae and Nilosyrtis region and consists of thin, criss-crossing ridges with a variety of heights, widths, and intersection angles. They are found in ancient Noachian terrains at a variety of altitudes (between -2500 and 2200 m) and geographic locations and are likely to be chemically altered fracture planes or mineral veins. They occur in the same general areas as valley networks and ancient lake basins, but they are not more numerous where these water-related features are concentrated, and can appear in places where th morphologies are absent. Similarly, some of the ridge networks are located near hydrated mineral detections, but there is not a one-to-one correlation. Smaller, light-toned ridges of variable widths have been found in Gale Crater and other rover sites and are interpreted to be smaller versions of the Nili-like ridges, mostly formed by the mineralization of fractures. This type of ridge is likely to be found in many other places on Mars as more high-resolution data become available. Sinus Meridiani contains many flat-topped ridges arranged into quasi-circular patterns. The ridges are eroding from a clay-rich unit, and could be formed by a similar process as the Nili-type ridges, but at a much larger scale and controlled by fractures made through a different process. Hellas Basin is host to a fourth type of ridge morphology consisting of large, thick, light-toned ridges forming regular polygons at several superimposed scales. While still enigmatic, these are most likely to be the result of sediment-filled fractures. The Eastern Medusae Fossae Formation contains large swaths of a fifth, previously undocumented, ridge network type. The dark ridges, reaching up to 50 m in height, enclose regular polygons and erode into dark boulders. These ridge networks are interpreted to form as a result of lava flow embayment of deeply fractured Medusae Fossae Formation outcrops.},

 abstract = {Striking circular, labyrinthine, polygonal, and striped patterns of stones and soil self-organize in many polar and high alpine environments. These forms emerge because freeze-thaw cycles drive an interplay between two feedback mechanisms. First, formation of ice lenses in freezing soil sorts stones and soil by displacing soil toward soil-rich domains and stones toward stone-rich domains. Second, stones are transported along the axis of elongate stone domains, which are squeezed and confined as freezing soil domains expand. In a numerical model implementing these feedbacks, circles, labyrinths, and islands form when sorting dominates; polygonal networks form when stone domain squeezing and confinement dominate; and stripes form as hillslope gradient is increased.},

 abstract = {We present new field, structural, petrographic, and geochronologic data on a rare midcrustal (∼25 km) exposure of a Cordilleran arc, the Coast Ridge Belt, located in the Santa Lucia Mountains of central California. The study area is composed primarily of a deformed suite of upper amphibolite to granulite facies rocks (the “Sur Series”), which is dominated by metaigneous tonalites, diorites, and gabbros with subordinate metasedimentary quartzite and marble. Inherited zircons in magmatic rocks suggest that the provenance of framework rocks is drawn heavily from miogeoclinal formations and that sedimentation occurred in the late Paleozoic or later. Minor magmatism in the Coast Ridge Belt began in the Early or Middle Cretaceous, but magmatic activity was most intense during a short period time from 93 to 81 Ma, based on U-Pb zircon ages of a felsic gneiss and two less-deformed diorites. The time period 93–81 Ma also brackets a period of extensive thickening and high-temperature ductile deformation. While a thrusting cause for ductile deformation cannot be ruled out, we favor the hypothesis that the exposed rocks correspond to a zone of return flow of supracrustal rocks locally displaced by granitoid plutons in the shallower crust. Magmatism ended throughout Salinia between 81 and 76 Ma, coincident with the attainment of peak pressure and temperature conditions of 0.75 GPa and 800°C. Exhumation followed immediately, bringing the Coast Ridge Belt to the surface within 8 My at a rate of at least 2–3 mm/yr. Exhumation was coincident with an episode of extensional collapse that has been documented elsewhere in the southern California arc during the early Laramide orogeny and that may be related to underthrusting of the forearc at that time.},

Many of these peridotite xenoliths are modified by either modal and/or cryptic Na-rich metasomatism, which produced elevated Sr/Y, La/Yb and La/Nb ratios typical of slab melts. Some of the metasomatized xenoliths, derived from a relatively deep and hot portion of the mantle, contain an interconnected network along mineral grain boundaries of high-Mg\#, low-Y andesitic glass with major and trace element composition similar to the high-Mg adakites erupted in the AVZ. We interpret this adakitic glass to be a quenched slab melt that has infiltrated the mantle wedge from below. The texture and chemistry of this quenched melt and surrounding mantle minerals suggest that selective assimilation of predominately mantle clinopyroxene, some spinel and minor olivine is an important process in producing high-Mg adakites from primary low-Mg slab melts.},

 abstract = {The role of black carbon (BC) soot in the Arctic as an agent of climate warming through forcing/feedback of sea ice/glacier albedo is an uncertainty in need of addressing. In-situ measurements of BC-aerosols and gas byproducts from the FROSTFIRE experiment burn, 8-11 July 1999, are used with a coupled high-resolution wind field/empirical fall-out model to assess transport/dispersion and estimate deposition. Results suggest that BC-aerosols (soot) are quickly transported from central Alaska to the Arctic Ocean region of multi-year sea ice and to southern Alaska glaciers, where up to 20\% can be deposited. The estimate of BC soot concentration from Alaska boreal wildfires favorably compares to in-situ sea ice observations made in 1998 and snow albedo observation on Gulkana Glacier in 2001. We hypothesize that northern boreal wildfires are a possible contributor in the reduction of first/multi-year sea ice/glacier extent by enhancing summer melting from albedo reduction. Should the occurrence and severity of northern boreal wildfires continue as in summer 2004, during which more than 670 km2 burned and was the worst wildfire year on record, there will be implications for Northern hemisphere climate warming. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

In the central Mexican subduction zone this appears as a thin (̃4 km) low-velocity zone that absorbs nearly all of the strain. The P-to-S velocity ratio as a function of S wave velocity distinguishes among the various candidate hydrous (low-strength) minerals; the thin layer in the flat-slab region is most consistent with a layer showing enrichment in talc overlying normal MORB-like gabbro. Based on available thermodynamic data for equilibria for talc, its generation at the trench is nearly impossible, and hence we propose it originates from the mantle wedge during the slab flattening process coupled with trench rollback. The evolution of this low-strength zone has important implications for the dynamics of the slab-flattening process as well as the geochemistry of the mantle wedge and arc in central Mexico. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

 abstract = {[1] We analyzed narrow-angle Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC-NA) images to produce high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) in order to provide topographic and slope information needed to assess the safety of candidate landing sites for the Mars Exploration Rovers ( MER) and to assess the accuracy of our results by a variety of tests. The mapping techniques developed also support geoscientific studies and can be used with all present and planned Mars-orbiting scanner cameras. Photogrammetric analysis of MOC stereopairs yields DEMs with 3-pixel ( typically 10 m) horizontal resolution, vertical precision consistent with similar to 0.22 pixel matching errors ( typically a few meters), and slope errors of 1 - 3degrees. These DEMs are controlled to the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) global data set and consistent with it at the limits of resolution. Photoclinometry yields DEMs with single-pixel ( typically similar to 3 m) horizontal resolution and submeter vertical precision. Where the surface albedo is uniform, the dominant error is 10 - 20\{$\backslash$\%\} relative uncertainty in the amplitude of topography and slopes after "calibrating'' photoclinometry against a stereo DEM to account for the influence of atmospheric haze. We mapped portions of seven candidate MER sites and the Mars Pathfinder site. Safety of the final four sites (Elysium, Gusev, Isidis, and Meridiani) was assessed by mission engineers by simulating landings on our DEMs of "hazard units'' mapped in the sites, with results weighted by the probability of landing on those units; summary slope statistics show that most hazard units are smooth, with only small areas of etched terrain in Gusev crater posing a slope hazard.},

 abstract = {Ancient sediments provide archives of climate and habitability on Mars. Gale Crater, the landing site for the Mars Science Laboratory ( MSL), hosts a 5-km-high sedimentary mound ( Mount Sharp/Aeolis Mons). Hypotheses for mound formation include evaporitic, lacustrine, fluviodeltaic, and aeolian processes, but the origin and original extent of Gale's mound is unknown. Here we show new measurements of sedimentary strata within the mound that indicate similar to 3 degrees outward dips oriented radially away from the mound center, inconsistent with the first three hypotheses. Moreover, although mounds are widely considered to be erosional remnants of a once crater-filling unit, we find that the Gale mound's current form is close to its maximal extent. Instead we propose that the mound's structure, stratigraphy, and current shape can be explained by growth in place near the center of the crater mediated by wind-topography feedbacks. Our model shows how sediment can initially accrete near the crater center far from crater-wall katabatic winds, until the increasing relief of the resulting mound generates mound-flank slope winds strong enough to erode the mound. The slope wind enhanced erosion and transport ( SWEET) hypothesis indicates mound formation dominantly by aeolian deposition with limited organic carbon preservation potential, and a relatively limited role for lacustrine and fluvial activity. Morphodynamic feedbacks between wind and topography are widely applicable to a range of sedimentary and ice mounds across the Martian surface, and possibly other planets.},

 abstract = {Unraveling the stratigraphic record is the key to understanding ancient climate and past climate changes on Mars (Grotzinger, J. et al. [2011]. Astrobiology 11, 77-87). Stratigraphic records of river deposits hold particular promise because rain or snowmelt must exceed infiltration plus evaporation to allow sediment transport by rivers. Therefore, river deposits when placed in stratigraphic order could constrain the number, magnitudes, and durations of the wettest (and presumably most habitable) climates in Mars history. We use crosscutting relationships to establish the stratigraphic context of river and alluvial-fan deposits in the Aeolis Dorsa sedimentary basin, 10°E of Gale crater. At Aeolis Dorsa, wind erosion has exhumed a stratigraphic section of sedimentary rocks consisting of at least four unconformity-bounded rock packages, recording three or more distinct episodes of surface runoff. Early deposits (700. m thick) are embayed by river deposits (400. m thick), which are in turn unconformably draped by fan-shaped deposits (100. m thick) which we interpret as alluvial fans. Yardang-forming layered deposits (900. m thick) unconformably drape all previous deposits.River deposits embay a dissected landscape formed of sedimentary rock. The river deposits are eroding out of at least two distinguishable units. There is evidence for pulses of erosion during the interval of river deposition. The total interval spanned by river deposits is (1×106-2×107) yr, and this is extended if we include alluvial-fan deposits. Alluvial-fan deposits unconformably postdate thrust faults which crosscut the river deposits. This relationship suggests a relatively dry interval of 4×107yr after the river deposits formed and before the fan-shaped deposits formed, based on probability arguments. Yardang-forming layered deposits unconformably postdate all of the earlier deposits. They contain rhythmite and their induration suggests a damp or wet (near-) surface environment. The time gap between the end of river deposition and the onset of yardang-forming layered deposits is constrained to 1×108yr by the high density of impact craters embedded at the unconformity. The time gap between the end of alluvial-fan deposition and the onset of yardang-forming layered deposits was at least long enough for wind-induced saltation abrasion to erode 20-30m into the alluvial-fan deposits. We correlate the yardang-forming layered deposits to the upper layers of Gale crater's mound (Mt. Sharp/Aeolis Mons), and the fan-shaped deposits to Peace Vallis fan in Gale crater. Alternations between periods of low mean obliquity and periods of high mean obliquity may have modulated erosion-deposition cycling in Aeolis. This is consistent with the results from an ensemble of simulations of Solar System orbital evolution and the resulting history of the obliquity of Mars. 57 of our 61 simulations produce one or more intervals of continuously low mean Mars obliquity that are long enough to match our Aeolis Dorsa unconformity data.},

 abstract = {The position of the transition from spinel Iherzolite to garnet Iherzolite in the system CaO-MgO-Al2O3-SiO2 (CMAS) has been determined experimentally at near-solidus temperatures. In reversed experiments, the transition occurs between 18 and 20 kbar at 1200 degrees C and between 26 and 27 kbar at 1500 degrees C, corresponding to higher pressures than previously envisaged. A position for the transition deeper within the Earth further complicates the explanation of the so-called garnet signatures in the trace element and isotope patterns of mid-ocean ridge basalts. If melting during adiabatic upwelling beneath a mid-ocean ridge begins at the depth required for the stability of garnet in peridotitic compositions, simple melting models predict that the amount of melt produced should be much greater than the observed thickness of the oceanic crust. A partial solution to the apparent conflict might be that (1) the rather simplistic melting models are in error, (2) that melting begins in garnet pyroxenite veins that are believed to be stable at lower pressures than garnet Iherzolite or (3) that melting does not involve garnet at all, but it is clinopyroxene causing the trace element patterns observed in basalts erupted at mid-ocean ridges. A second set of reversal experiments were conducted to investigate the solubility of alumina in both orthopyroxenes and clinopyroxenes at the high temperatures near the solidus in the system CMAS. The results are compatible with most previous studies, and may be used as a starting point to calibrate thermodynamic models for pyroxenes in chem mating upper mantle chemistry. in chemical systems, approximating upper mantle chemistry.},

Cambrian radiation may have been triggered by environmental perturbation near the Proterozoic-Cambrian boundary and subsequently amplified by ecological interactions within reorganized ecosystems.},

 abstract = {Eolian dune ﬁelds on Earth and Mars evolve as complex systems within a set of boundary conditions. A source-to-sink comparison indicates that although differences exist in sediment production and transport, the systems largely converge at the dune-ﬂow and pattern-development levels, but again differ in modes of accumulation and preservation. On Earth, where winds frequently exceed threshold speeds, dune ﬁelds are sourced primarily through deﬂation of subaqueous deposits as these sediments become available for transport. Limited weathering, widespread permafrost, and the lowdensity atmosphere on Mars imply that sediment production, sediment availability, and sand-transporting winds are all episodic. Possible sediment sources include relict sediments from the wetter Noachian; slow physical weathering in a cold, water-limited environment; and episodic sediment production associated with climatic cycles, outﬂow events, and impacts. Similarities in dune morphology, secondary airﬂow patterns over the dunes, and pattern evolution through dune interactions imply that dune stratiﬁcation and bounding surfaces on Mars are comparable to those on Earth, an observation supported by outcrops of the Burns formation. The accumulation of eolian deposits occurs on Earth through the dynamics of dry, wet, and stabilizing eolian systems. Dry-system accumulation by ﬂow deceleration into topographic basins has occurred throughout Martian history, whereas wetsystem accumulation with a rising capillary fringe is restricted to Noachian times. The greatest difference in accumulation occurs with stabilizing systems, as manifested by the north polar Planum Boreum cavi unit, where accumulation has occurred through stabilization by permafrost development. Preservation of eolian accumulations on Earth typically occurs by sediment burial within subsiding basins or a relative rise of the water table or sea level. Preservation on Mars, measured as the generation of a stratigraphic record and not time, has an Earth analog with inﬁll of impact-created and other basins, but differs with the cavi unit, where preservation is by burial beneath layered ice with a climatic driver.},

 abstract = {The relatively unknown volcanism of the Azas Plateau in the Tuva Republic is linked with the Baikal Rift system and it presents many excellently preserved tuyas that are volcanic edifices formed by subice and underwater eruptions. These tuyas were formed in the Quaternary, when eruptions characterized by trachybasalt and basanite compositions coincided with extensive glaciation in southern Siberia. Their stratigraphy is typically composed of very thick, weak and often layered hyaloclastite sequences, and near horizontal lava cap layers produced by subaerial eruptions. The interior layered deposits (ILDs) in Valles Marineris of Mars, in general, overlie unconformably canyon floors, canyon walls, and in some cases, chaotic terrain with onlap geometry. Many of these ILD mounds have either flat-topped or domal profiles. Thin layers of a few to tens of meters in thickness are extensively observed with relatively limited post-depositional deformations, stacking up to form hundreds to possibly thousands of meters-thick sequences. One example shows possible cross-beds, but bedforms in the layers are rare within the studied MOC images. These characteristics are indicative of low-energy depositional environments such as lacustrine basins or air-falls of dust or volcanic ash rather than sediments deposited in strong currents. Volcanic sheet flows and distal facies of turbidites, however, could be also similar to some thin layers of the ILDs. The ILD mounds are also associated with possible volcanic landforms such as feeding dikes, volcanic necks and vents. Cap units, if layered, are in general near horizontal whereas lower strata could have an angular unconformity relationship with the cap layers, which can be interpreted as lava-fed deltas. These observations support the hypothesis of subice and/or underwater volcanism for the formation of the ILDs. However, not all ILDs have ideal tuya morphology and stratigraphy, implying more complex history of the ILDs in Valles Marineris. The complex interactions between rift formation, associated volcanism, ice coverage due to climate change and floods are observed in the Baikal Rift system of southern Siberia and these could be direct analogues for the Valles Marineris region of Mars. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The unconformity is overlain by a strikingly uniform and little disturbed dolomite bed. Above this dolomite the intensity of deformation once more increases; it reaches its maximum in this upper deformed unit.

 abstract = {This study uses a 3D petroleum system modelling approach to investigate the links between hydrocarbon generation and migration with observed gas chimneys and gas leakage features along the western margin of offshore South Africa. In addition we have investigated the impact and timing of mass failures and related .sediment mass movement on the petroleum system and hydrocarlx)n maturation history within the southern Orange Basin. Our 3D-modeI covers this passive margin's evolution from Early Cretaceous drift initiation to the e.stablishment of a present day continental margin, extending from the shelf to the deep marine domain. The model is based on interpreted 2D seismic profiles and borehole data including sedimentological and geochemical analyses as well as heat flow data. The model includes a proven .source rock of Aptian/Albian age, and a second assumed Cenomanian Turonian source. Several heat flow and uplift-erosion scenarios have been tested with the model to assess consi.stency with calibration data and present day surface heat flow values. After calibration against known well temperatures and vitrinite reflectance hydrocarbon generation and migration have been modelled to investigate the initiation, duration and spatial di.stribution of petroleum accumulation and leakage within and through(iut the sedimentary column. The main sedimentary depocentres of the Orange Basin developed from east to west, with a siliciclastic basin infill and aggradation during the Cretaceous and westward progradation during the Late Cenozoic. A Late Cretaceous epi.sode of margin instability occurred in the north western part of the study area followed by a second phase of Late Cenozoic mass movement in the south-western part of the study area. At the location of the Cretaceous mass failure the increase in .sediment load profoundly affected the underlying source rocks seen in modelled maturation and petroleum generation potential. Albian .source rocks .started hydrocarbon transformation 100 to 85 Ma ago (phases I to III) in the centre of the basin and between 75 to 65 Ma ago (phase IV and VI) towards the distal part of the basin. The highest generation rates occurred at 75 Ma, followed by a rapid decrease until 15 Ma and a slight increase in generation potential until present day (phase V) caused by enhanced Cenozoic sediment load we.st of the Cretaceous shelf break. This recent increase accounts for the location of present day gas generation, though it dcx;s not substantially affect the overall regional maturation history. Today's gas leakage features that have been observed in the shelf area (400 m water depth) ea,st of the slope failures are fed by an active hydrocarbon system. Compared to these gas leakage sites, the location of gas generation in the outer basin implies subsequent migration of the fluids towards the near-shore part of the basin. Our modelling constrains the migration pathways, timing and duration ot the gas leakage and gives a basin-scale quantification of episodes with enhanced thertnogenic gas generation and leakage.},

@article{Kuhn2010,
 abstract = {The Arauco basin is part of the coastal forearc domain in South-Central Chile. During its evolution since the Late Cretaceous it was subject to multiple deposition cycles and the erosion of lower bathyal to beach and lagoon sediments. These different environments were established in alternating accretional and erosive subduction tectonic settings along the South Andean active margin. Whereas the general development is well understood, inconsistencies arise regarding the origin of the high thermal maturity of Eocene coals and the estimates of vertical movements of the whole area during the Cenozoic. Thermal modelling of this forearc basin provides new insights regarding its thermal evolution and evaluation of the magnitudes of subsidence and inversion. Results are based on the analysis of coal samples from surface outcrops, mines and drill cores of ten onshore wells from ENAP/Sipetrol. Newly derived vitrinite reflectance (VRr) measurements indicated a temperature in the range of 135-150 ??C for the oldest sediment unit of the Arauco basin, which was reached in post Eocene times. Furthermore, 1D basin modelling techniques indicate scenarios that could explain the coalification values in the basin's sediments. The models were calibrated against VRr data from drill core samples supplied by ENAP/Sipetrol. A Miocene and an Oligocene subsidence/inversion scenario were considered, while neither could be securely discarded based on the modelling results. Furthermore, it can be shown that the current thermal maturity was not reached by an increased heat flow (HF) or a deep subsidence only. Consequently, a structural inversion accompanied by the erosion of ̃3.0??0.4 km depending on the locality in combination with a high HF of ̃64??4 mW/m2 is the best explanation of the available data. The HF, which is high for a forearc setting, can be attributed to the increased temperature of the relatively young subducted Nazca Plate and an additional influence of ascending hot fluids from the subduction zone. The maximum temperature gradient inferred is 30 ??C/km. Furthermore, the petroleum generation potential of the basin is considered to be rather low based on our results. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Kumar2012,
 abstract = {As early as the 1920s, Gutenberg (1926) equated the low-viscosity asthenosphere with a seismic low-velocity zone. Regions of high and low velocity in the mantle are today usually determined with tomographic methods. These methods are, however, not very sensitive to sharp boundaries. Converted waves have been used for many years to study boundaries in the mantle. A velocity reduction with depth (possibly the lithosphereasthenosphere boundary, LAB) was found with P-to-S converted waves (P-receiver functions) beneath North America at ̃100 km depth with a sharpness of about 10 km (Rychert and Shearer 2009). A comparison of the LAB depth from S-receiver functions (see, e.g., Yuan et al. 2006 and Kumar et al. 2006 for a description of the method and data examples) with that from surface-wave tomography found good agreement in the western United States (Li et al. 2007) and along the East Coast (Rychert et al. 2007). Our results from the California coast are also consistent with the P-to-S and S-to-P images earlier analyzed by Kumar and Kawakatsu (2011), along a profile spanning ocean to continent. A discrepancy exists in the central part of the craton, where the sharp velocity decrease at about 100 km in P-receiver functions (PRF) was confirmed with S-receiver functions (SRF) in contrast to the smooth velocity decrease around 200 km depth known from surface-wave data (Yuan and Romanowicz 2010; Abt et al. 2010; Yuan et al. 2011). The petrophysical nature of the LAB is still very much a subject of discussion (e.g., Eaton et al. 2009; Fischer et al. 2010). We think our results from USArray data significantly contribute to this discussion. The earlier results were obtained with relatively few, sparsely distributed seismic stations (Abt et al. 2010). We apply the S-receiver function technique to the much larger amount of data from the USArray project (http:// www.usarray.org) for LAB observations.},

@article{Kump1999,
 abstract = {New paired carbonate and organic-carbon isotope analyses from Nevada, USA, together with a consideration of the effects of mountain-building and ice-sheet coverage of the continents on atmospheric pCO2, lead to a new hypothesis for the cause of the Late Ordovician glaciation. We suggest that the Taconic orogeny, which commenced in the late-middle Ordovician, caused a long-term decline in atmospheric pCO2 through increased weatherability of silicate rocks. Ice-sheet growth was triggered when pCO2 decreased to a threshold of ∼10× present atmospheric level and proceeded by positive ice-albedo feedback. In the midst of glaciation, atmospheric pCO2 began to rise as continental silicate weathering rates declined in response to coverage of weathering terrains by ice sheets. At first, this enhanced greenhouse effect was overcompensated for by ice-albedo effects. Ultimately, however, atmospheric pCO2 reached a level which overwhelmed the cooling effects of ice albedo, and the glaciation ended. The isotope results can be interpreted to indicate that atmospheric pCO2 rose during the glaciation, consistent with other proxy information, although alternative interpretations are possible. The large, positive carbonate isotope excursion observed in Late Ordovician rocks around the world is explained as the expected response to increased carbonate-platform weathering during glacioeustatic sea-level lowstand, rather than as a response to increased organic-carbon burial.},

 abstract = {The Cardenas Basalt, a 300-m-thick flow sequence, occurs in the middle of the 4000-m-thick Proterozoic sedimentary sequence in the Grand Canyon. It consists of a 100-m-thick lower member composed of about six, poorly exposed, coarsely ophitic pahoehoe flows of olivine basalt. In contrast, the upper member, 200 m thick, comprises four to six, resistant, aphyric, intersertal to intergranular flows that range from quartz tholeiite to tholeiitic andesite (icelandite). Petrographically, mafic intrusions exposed throughout the Inner Gorge of the Grand Canyon are similar to the lower member. Newly acquired RbSr isotopic data, in combination with those previously available, define a well-constrained isochron (10 points) at 1103??66 Ma. This date is concordant with a RbSr date from one of the mafic intrusions, supporting the conclusion that the Grand Canyon mafic magmatic episode occurred ??? 1.1 Ga. The magma that fed both the intrusions and the lower member appears to have been principally derived from a slightly enriched mantle source. Subsequently, this magma underwent ??? 20\% fractionation of olivine and, possibly, minor assimilation of continental crust. Differences in SiO2, A12O3, TiO2, and P2O5 contents between the lower member and intrusions, apparently reflect heterogeneities in the mantle source, or different degrees of melting and/or crustal assimilation. The quartz-tholeiite magma of the upper member apparently resulted from more-extensive fractionation and crustal contamination of a mantle-derived magma. After its formation, this magma underwent further fractionation to produce, tholeiitic andesite (icelandite). ?? 1994.},

 abstract = {A deterministic attitude estimation problem for a rigid body in an attitude dependent potential field with bounded measurement errors is studied. An attitude estimation scheme that does not use generalized coordinate representations of the attitude is presented here. Assuming that the initial attitude, angular velocity and measurement noise lie within given ellipsoidal bounds, an uncertainty ellipsoid that bounds the attitude and the angular velocity of the rigid body is obtained. The center of the uncertainty ellipsoid provides point estimates, and its size gives the accuracy of the estimates. The point estimates and the uncertainty ellipsoids are propagated using a Lie group variational integrator and its linearization, respectively. The estimation scheme is optimal in the sense that the attitude estimation error and the size of the uncertainty ellipsoid is minimized at each measurement instant, and it is global since the attitude is represented by a rotation matrix},

 abstract = {Olivine/melt and orthopyroxene/melt rare-earth element (REE) partition coefficients consistent with clinopyroxene/melt partition coefficients were determined indirectly from subsolidus partitioning between olivine, orthopyroxene, and clinopyroxene after suitable correction for temperature. Heavy- and middle-REE ratios for olivine/clinopyroxene and orthopyroxene/clinopyroxene pairs correlate negatively with effective cationic radius, whereas those for the light REEs correlate positively with cationic radius, generating a U-shaped pattern in apparent mineral/clinopyroxene partition coefficients versus cationic radius. Lattice strain models of partitioning modified for subsolidus conditions yield negative correlations of olivine/clinopyroxene and orthopyroxene/clinopyroxene with respect to cationic radii, predicting well the measured partitioning behaviors of the heavy and middle REEs but not that of the light REEs. The light-REE systematics cannot be explained with lattice strain theory and, instead, can be explained by disequilibrium enrichment of the light REEs in melt inclusions or on the rims of olivine and orthopyroxene. Realistic light-REE partition coefficients were thus extrapolated from the measured heavy- and middle-REE partition coefficients using the lattice strain model. Light REE olivine/melt and orthopyroxene/melt partition coefficients calculated in this manner are lower than most published values, but agree reasonably well with partitioning experiments using the most recent in situ analytical techniques (secondary-ionization mass spectrometry and laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry). These new olivine/melt and orthopyroxene/melt partition coefficients are useful for accurate modeling of the REE contents of clinopyroxene-poor to -free lithologies, such as harzburgitic residues of melting. Finally, the application of the lattice strain theory to subsolidus conditions represents a framework for assessing the degree of REE disequilibrium in a rock.},

@article{Lee2009,
 abstract = {Basaltic magmatism is a common feature of dynamically active terrestrial planets. The compositions of basalts reflect the temperatures and pressures of magma generation, providing windows into a planet's thermal state. Here, we present new thermobarometers based on magma Si and Mg contents to estimate the pressures and temperatures of basaltic magma generation on Earth and other terrestrial planets. Melting on Earth is intimately tied to plate tectonics and occurs mostly at plate boundaries: mid-ocean ridges and subduction zones. Beneath ridges, melting is driven by adiabatic decompression of passively upwelling mantle at 1300-1400????C. Similar temperatures of melting are found for some arcs, suggesting that decompression melting is also important in arcs and that enhanced melting by hydrous fluxing is superimposed on this background. However, in arcs where melting temperatures are low (1200????C), hydrous fluxing is required. Temperatures hotter than ridges ( 1400????C) are primarily found away from plate boundaries: beneath thick continental lithosphere and oceanic "hotspots" like Hawaii. Oceanic "hotspots" are thought to derive from deep thermal upwellings ("plumes"), but some hot anomalies beneath continents are not associated with deep-seated plumes and hence must have different origins, such as thermal insulation or radioactive heating of metasomatized zones. Melting on Venus, as constrained from spectral data of its surface, occurs at higher temperatures (1500????C) and pressures than on Earth, perhaps because Venus is characterized by a thick and stagnant upper thermal boundary layer that retards convective heat loss. In this regard, Venus' upper thermal boundary layer may be analogous to thick continents on Earth. Mars appears to have cooled off to  1300????C within its first billion years, but considerable controversy exists over the interpretation of young ( 500??My) basaltic meteorites that record temperatures of 1550????C. As for the first billion years of Earth's history, its upper mantle was hotter than 1700????C, hence melting commenced at pressures greater than 7??GPa, where melts could have been denser than residual solids, resulting in downward fertilization of the Earth's mantle. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

 abstract = {The detection of methane on Mars has revived the possibility of past or extant life on this planet, despite the fact that an abiogenic origin is thought to be equally plausible. An intriguing aspect of the recent observations of methane on Mars is that methane concentrations appear to be locally enhanced and change with the seasons. However, methane has a photochemical lifetime of several centuries, and is therefore expected to have a spatially uniform distribution on the planet. Here we use a global climate model of Mars with coupled chemistry to examine the implications of the recently observed variations of Martian methane for our understanding of the chemistry of methane. We find that photochemistry as currently understood does not produce measurable variations in methane concentrations, even in the case of a current, local and episodic methane release. In contrast, we find that the condensation-sublimation cycle of Mars' carbon dioxide atmosphere can generate large-scale methane variations differing from those observed. In order to reproduce local methane enhancements similar to those recently reported, we show that an atmospheric lifetime of less than 200 days is necessary, even if a local source of methane is only active around the time of the observation itself. This implies an unidentified methane loss process that is 600 times faster than predicted by standard photochemistry. The existence of such a fast loss in the Martian atmosphere is difficult to reconcile with the observed distribution of other trace gas species. In the case of a destruction mechanism only active at the surface of Mars, destruction of methane must occur with an even shorter timescale of the order of approximately 1 hour to explain the observations. If recent observations of spatial and temporal variations of methane are confirmed, this would suggest an extraordinarily harsh environment for the survival of organics on the planet.},

 abstract = {The Southern Sierra Nevada mountain range rapidly uplifted at ≈ 3.5 Ma simultaneously with a pulse of basaltic volcanism. Xenoliths recovered from volcanics indicate that the range lost a dense crustal root after the Miocene. The vertical motions and removal of the root have been linked to a fast seismic velocity anomaly that extends ≈ 200 km into the mantle but is offset to the west of the range. With visco-elasto-plastic thermo-mechanical numerical models, we have tested the influence of crustal strength on the kinematics of removal and on the amount of associated uplift. We find that delamination of the dense root is the most likely mechanism for gravitational instability to occur. The model satisfies the Plio-Quaternary vertical motions, the shift of the mantle anomaly to the west of the range, and intense Miocene extension to the east. Based on those results, we propose the existence of a dynamic link between the Sierra Nevada mantle instability and Death Valley rifting. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{LeRoux2007,
 abstract = {Differentiation of the Earth's mantle and formation of continental and oceanic crust occur principally through partial melting and extraction of basaltic melt. Among the mantle rocks occurring at the Earth's surface, as tectonically-emplaced massifs, abyssal peridotites or xenoliths, the harzburgites ( 5\% clinopyroxene) are widely considered as refractory mantle residues left after extraction of a basaltic component. In contrast, the most fertile lherzolites (15\% clinopyroxene) are generally regarded as pristine mantle, only weakly affected by partial melting. In this paper we present new convergent structural and geochemical data from the Lherz massif, the type-locality of lherzolite, indicating that the lherzolites from Lherz do not represent pristine mantle. Detailed structural mapping clearly shows that the lherzolites are secondary rocks formed at the expense of the harzburgites. Variations of major, minor and trace elements through the harzburgite-lherzolite contacts indicate that the lherzolites were formed through a refertilization process involving interaction of refractory, lithospheric mantle with upwelling asthenospheric partial melts. Combined with previously published indications of refertilization in orogenic peridotites, our new observations in Lherz suggest that most lherzolite massifs represent secondary (refertilized) rather than pristine mantle. Together with geochemical data on mantle xenoliths, this indicates that melt transport and melt-rock reaction play a key role on the rejuvenation and erosion of the lithospheric mantle. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

 abstract = {We have produced common conversion point (CCP) stacked Ps and Sp receiver function image volumes of the Moho and lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB) beneath the western United States using Transportable Array data. The large image volumes and the diversity of tectonic environments they encompass allow us to investigate evolution of these structural discontinuities. The Moho is a nearly continuous topographic surface, whereas the LAB is not and the seismic images show a more complex expression. The first order change in LAB depth in the western U.S. occurs along the Cordilleran hingeline, the former Laurasian passive margin along the southwestern Precambrian North American terranes. The LAB is about 50\% deeper to the east of the hingeline than to the west, with most of the increase in LAB thickness being in the mantle lithosphere. We infer that the Moho and the LAB are Late Mesozoic or Cenozoic everywhere west of the hingeline, modified during Farallon subduction and its aftermath. Between the hingeline and the Rocky Mountain Front, the LAB, and to a lesser extent the Moho, have been partially reset during the Cenozoic by processes that continue today. Seismicity and recent volcanism in the interior of the western U.S. are concentrated along gradients in crustal and/or lithospheric thickness, for example the hingeline, and the eastern edge of the coastal volcanic-magmatic terranes. To us this suggests that lateral gradients in integrated lithospheric strength focus deformation. Similarly, areas conjectured to be the sites of convective downwellings and associated volcanism are located along gradients in regional lithosphere thickness.},

 abstract = {Sedimentary rocks preserved on the surface of Mars represent a natural archive of past climate conditions. Although the details of their formation often remain poorly constrained, the recent detection of rhythmic bedding patterns in the Arabia Terra region suggests the inﬂuence of orbital variations on sedimentary deposition. Here we detail a number of new sites which exhibit quasiperiodic stratigraphic variations, demonstrating their occurrence throughout the equatorial region of the planet. We characterize these recorded signals as well as the local geomorphic context and structural attributes. Two cyclic units are identiﬁed within Gale crater, the landing site of the Mars Science Laboratory mission, enabling estimation of possible formation timescales for the geologic units that may be studied in situ by the rover. We ﬁnd a general lack of ﬂuvial features in connection with rhythmic geologic units, contrasting these sites with the aperiodic deltaic stratigraphy found at Eberswalde crater. Possible formation scenarios and their climatic implications are discussed for the diverse set of quasiperiodic sedimentary units. We propose multiple depositional pathways for recording cyclic climate changes, including repeated evaporitic precipitation from groundwater discharge in topographic lows as well as largely anhydrous accumulation of atmospheric dust for deposits outside of conﬁned basins. The preservation of orbital signals in sediments distributed across a wide range of geographic settings suggests a pervasive inﬂuence on Martian climate conditions through time.},

@article{Lister1989,
 abstract = {Metamorphic core complexes form as the result of major continental extension, when the middle and lower continental crust is dragged out from beneath the fracturing, extending upper crust. Movement zones capable of producing such effects evolve in space as well as with time. Deforming rocks in the footwall are uplifted through a progression of different metamorphic and deformational environments, producing a characteristic sequence of (overprinted) meso- and microstructures. The movement zone is folded as the result of the bowing upwards of the lower crust to form a broad basement culmination, as the result of isostatic rebound due to tectonic denudation, but most likely also as the result of local isostatic adjustments due to granite intrusion in the middle crust. A succession of splays branch off from the master detachment fault at depth, excising substantial portions of the lower portions of the upper plate as successive detachment faults eat upwards through it. At the same time, detachment faults incise into progressively deeper levels of the lower plate, although the amount of incision is limited, because the locus of movement remains at approximately the same level in the lower plate. The detachment faults presently observed in the metamorphic core complexes are relatively young features, formed late in the geological evolution of these bodies, and are only the last in a succession of low-angle normal faults that sliced through the upper crust at the upward terminations of major, shallow-dipping, ductile shear zones in the extending Cordilleran orogen. Excisement of listric fault bottoms can explain some of the enigmatic domino-like fault blocks, and other structural relations observed in these terranes. Evidence in support of this model is illustrated from detachment terranes in the northern Colorado River region of southern Nevada, southeastern California and western Arizona, where multiple generations of detachment faults have produced remarkable excisement and incisement geometries.},

@article{Liu1992,
 abstract = {We present the results of numerical simulations of Cenozoic volcanism in the Coast Ranges of California, associated with the northward migration of the Mendocino Triple Junction (MTJ). Three aspects of the thermal evolution and magmatism in the wake of the MTJ are investigated: (1) mantle flow and thermal perturbation in the "slabless window"; (2) pressure-release partial melting in the upwelling asthenosphere; and (3) thermally induced crustal anatexis. Numerical results show that upwelling of asthenosphere in the "slabless window" causes a drastic change in the thermal structure of the lithosphere and results in significant pressure-release partial melting in the upwelling asthenosphere. Up to 4-5 km of basaltic magma may be produced. Most of this mafic magma is likely stored near the base of the crust. Thermally induced crustal anatexis mainly occurs in the deep crust (below 20 km), where a high degree (50\%) of partial melting may be predicted. Most of the crustal melt is probably generated within 1 m.y. after the passage of the MTJ. This work also suggests that the spatial and temporal distribution of Cenozoic volcanism in the California Coastal Ranges is directly related to the variation of the relative velocity between the North America and Pacific plates in the last 30 m.y. The voluminous volcanic rocks in the northern California Coast Ranges correlate to the relatively high velocity between these two plates in the last 10 m.y. The reduced volcanism in the central Coast Ranges may be related to the slow migration of the MTJ between 10 and 20 Ma. Copyright 1992 by the American Geophysical Union.},

 abstract = {The origin of the Steens-Columbia River (SCR) flood basalts, which is presumed to be the onset of Yellowstone volcanism, has remained controversial, with the proposed conceptual models involving either a mantle plume or back-arc processes. Recent tomographic inversions based on the USArray data reveal unprecedented detail of upper-mantle structures of the western USA and tightly constrain geodynamic models simulating Farallon subduction, which has been proposed to influence the Yellowstone volcanism. Here we show that the best-fitting geodynamic model depicts an episode of slab tearing about 17 million years ago under eastern Oregon, where an associated sub-slab asthenospheric upwelling thermally erodes the Farallon slab, leading to formation of a slab gap at shallow depth. Driven by a gradient of dynamic pressure, the tear ruptured quickly north and south and within about two million years covering a distance of around 900 kilometres along all of eastern Oregon and northern Nevada. This tear would be consistent with the occurrence of major volcanic dikes during the SCR-Northern Nevada Rift flood basalt event both in space and time. The model predicts a petrogenetic sequence for the flood basalt with sources of melt starting from the base of the slab, at first remelting oceanic lithosphere and then evolving upwards, ending with remelting of oceanic crust. Such a progression helps to reconcile the existing controversies on the interpretation of SCR geochemistry and the involvement of the putative Yellowstone plume. Our study suggests a new mechanism for the formation of large igneous provinces.},

Evidence from South America indicates that one such reason may be the subduction of buoyant ocean floor. We here extend the low-angle subduction models by attributing the shallowing of the subduction angle during the Laramide orogeny to subduction of a large oceanic plateau of anomalously thick and buoyant oceanic crust. Pacific plate history indicates that a twin to the Hess Rise may represent the oceanic plateau that triggered Laramide events.},

 abstract = {A correction procedure is proposed to account for the effect of secondary X-ray fluorescence near grain boundaries in electron microprobe analysis. The procedure is based on the Monte Carlo simulation method, which is used to calculate the X-ray spectrum emitted by the mineral couple (i.e., the mineral of interest with the neighboring mineral). The contribution of secondary fluorescence from the neighboring mineral, which appears in the simulated spectrum in a natural way, is then subtracted from the measured k-ratio and thereafter conventional matrix corrections are applied. The Monte Carlo simulation algorithm used is largely based on the general-purpose simulation package PENELOPE. In order to assess the reliability of this code, simulated "apparent" element profiles are compared with electron microprobe measurements found in the literature, in which the effect of secondary fluorescence was characterized and the reliability of the different assumptions underlying the proposed procedure is discussed. Finally, the procedure is used to assess data from the olivine-clinopyroxene thermobarometer in a spinel lherzolite xenolith. The application of the secondary fluorescence correction leads to: (1) higher systematic pressure estimations than those obtained from uncorrected data, with lower uncertainties; and (2) a better agreement between the olivine-clinopyroxene temperature estimations and those estimated using the two-pyroxene thermometer. Estimated P-T conditions indicate a decompressional path with a slight decrease in temperature from core to crystal rim. However, if the effect of secondary fluorescence is not taken into account, an apparent heating event is observed.},

 abstract = {Compilation of a simplified geologic/geomorphic map onto digital terrain models of the Valles Marineris permitted an evaluation of elevations in the vicinity of the troughs and the calculation of depth of troughs below surrounding plateaus, thickness of deposits inside the troughs, volumes of void spaces above geologic/geomorphic units, and volumes of deposits. The central roughs north Ophir, north and central Candor, and north Melas Chasmata lie as much as 11 km below the adjacent plateaus. In Ophir and Candor Chasmata, interior layered deposits reach 8 km in elevation. If the deposits are lacustrine and if all troughs were interconnected, lake waters standing 8 km high would have spilled out of Coprates Chasma onto the surrounding plateaus having surface elevations of only 4-5 km. In this case, interior deposits above about 4 km in the central troughs would not be lacustrine. They could be volcanic. On the other hand, the troughs may not have been interconnected at the time of interior-deposit emplacement; they may have formed isolated ancestral basins. The existence of such basins is supported by independent structural and stratigraphic evidence. The ancestral basins may have eventually merged, perhaps through renewed faulting, to form northern subsidiary troughs in Ophir and Candor Chasmata and the Coprates/north Melas/Ius graben system. The peripheral troughs are only 2-5 km deep, shallower than the central troughs. They may have formed from a combination of erosional collapse and structural activity. Chaotic terrain is been in the peripheral troughs near a common contour level of about 4 km on the adjacent plateaus, which supports the idea of release of water under artesian pressure from confined aquifers. The layered deposits in the peripheral troughs may have formed in isolated depressions that harbored lakes and predated the formation of the deep outflow channels. If these layered deposits are of volcanic origin, they may have been emplaced beneath ice in the manner of table mountains. Areal and volumetric computations show that erosion widened the troughs by about one-third and that deposits occupy one-sixth of the interior space. Even though the volume eroded is larger than the volume deposited, topographic and geologic considerations imply that material eroded from trough walls was probably part of the interior layered deposits but not their sole source. Additional material may have come from subterranean piping, from reworking of local disintegration products on the floors, such as chaotic materials, or from eolian influx. But overall it is likely that the additional material is volcanic and that it forms mostly the upper, more diversely, bedded layers of the interior deposits.},

Most focal mechanism inversions are assumed to represent the bulk regional stresses, yet fault irregularity and observed small-scale stress changes in boreholes suggest a strong degree of local heterogeneity. We present geologic paleostress inversion results from a segment of the folded West Salton detachment fault located in a left stepover in the San Felipe dextral fault zone of Southern California (United States). Extension and dextral slip in this region were synchronous during latest detachment slip. The local (1–10 km scale) vertical stress field alternated from σ1 during extension to σ3 during flex-slip folding of the detachment in a restraining bend of the San Felipe fault zone (where σ1, σ2, and σ3 are the maximum, intermediate, and minimum principal stress directions, respectively). Regionally (10–100 km scale), we infer that the vertical stress alternates from σ1 during extension to σ2 during dextral slip. Both are consistent with nearly complete earthquake stress drops. If the fault-slip data set records paleoseismic strains, the magnitudes of differential stress and stress drop must be similar. Both may be relatively small during tectonic transitions.},

 abstract = {Slip on low-angle normal faults is not well understood because they slip at high angles to the maximum principal stress directions. These faults are considered weak and their motion cannot be explained using standard Byerlee friction and Andersonian fault mechanics. One proposed mechanism for weak fault slip is reduction of effective normal stress induced by high pore-fluid pressure. This mechanism is likely to allow dilation of the fault zone and, therefore, affect the particle-size distribution of fault breccia, which has been shown to differ for unconstrained versus constrained comminution. High pore-fluid pressure can cause dilation which leads to unconstrained comminution. We analyze samples from the footwalls of two low-angle normal faults in southern California (West Salton and Whipple detachment faults) to determine the fault-rock textures and grain-size distributions (GSDs). The GSDs are fractal with fractal dimensions ranging from ̃2.6 to 3.4. The lower end of this range is thought to reflect constrained comminution and only occurs in samples from the footwall of a small-offset "minidetachment" fault about 100m below the Whipple detachment. The higher fractal dimensions are common in cataclasites related to the main faults and also reflect constrained comminution but are overprinted by shear localization. Our GSDs are similar to those from natural and laboratory-deformed fault rocks from strong faults. We conclude that if high pore-fluid pressure aided slip on these faults, it did not strongly affect mechanisms by which brecciation occurs, implying that fluid pressure generally was sublithostatic. Independent evidence exists for lithostatic fluid pressure that having dropped or cycled to hydrostatic levelsin the minidetachment, but our GSD results suggest that periods of high fluid pressure were too short or infrequent for unconstrained comminution to have been the dominant cataclastic mechanism. Fractal dimensions of ̃2.6 for these samples suggest that little subsequent abrasion occurred due to shear localization, consistent with minor offset on the minidetachment. Main detachment footwall samples with fractal dimensions ???3 reflect constrained comminution followed by shear-related abrasion, and suggest that seismic cycling was important in formation of main detachment cataclasites. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

 abstract = {The area burned in the North American boreal forest is controlled by the frequency of mid-tropospheric blocking highs that cause rapid fuel drying. Climate controls the area burned through changing the dynamics of large-scale teleconnection patterns (Pacific Decadal Oscillation/El Niño Southern Oscillation and Arctic Oscillation, PDO/ENSO and AO) that control the frequency of blocking highs over the continent at different time scales. Changes in these teleconnections may be caused by the current global warming. Thus, an increase in temperature alone need not be associated with an increase in area burned in the North American boreal forest. Since the end of the Little Ice Age, the climate has been unusually moist and variable: large fire years have occurred in unusual years, fire frequency has decreased and fire-climate relationships have occurred at interannual to decadal time scales. Prolonged and severe droughts were common in the past and were partly associated with changes in the PDO/ENSO system. Under these conditions, large fire years become common, fire frequency increases and fire-climate relationships occur at decadal to centennial time scales. A suggested return to the drier climate regimes of the past would imply major changes in the temporal dynamics of fire-climate relationships and in area burned, a reduction in the mean age of the forest, and changes in species composition of the North American boreal forest.},

@article{Mancktelow1997,
 abstract = {Both erosion and surface topography cause a time-dependent variation in isotherm geometry that can result in significant errors in estimating natural exhumation rates from geochronologic data. Analytical solutions and two-dimensional numerical modelling are used to investigate the magnitude of these inaccuracies for conditions appropriate to many rapidly exhumed mountain chains of rugged relief. It is readily demonstrated that uplift of the topographic surface has a negligible effect on the cooling history of an exhumed rock sample and cannot be quantified by current geochronologic methods. The topography itself perturbs the isotherms to a depth that depends on both the vertical and horizontal scale of the surface relief. Estimations employing different isotopic systems in the same sample with higher closure temperatures ( 200Â°C) are not generally influenced by topography. However, direct conversion of cooling rates to exhumation rates assuming a simple constant linear geotherm markedly underestimates peak rates, due to variation of the geothermal gradient in time and space and to the time lag between exhumation and cooling. Estimations based on the altitude variation in apatite fission-track ages are less prone to such inaccuracies in geothermal gradient but are affected by near-surface time-dependent variation in isotherm depth due to advection and topography. In tectonically active mountain belts, high exhumation rates are coupled with rugged topography, and exhumation rates may be markedly overestimated, by factors of 2 or more. Even at lower exhumation rates on the order of 1 mm/a, the shape of the cooling curve is modified by advection and topography. A convex-concave shape to the cooling curve does not necessarily imply a change of exhumation rate; it may also be attained by a more complicated geothermal gradient induced by topographic relief. Very fast cooling below 100Â°C, often interpreted as reflecting faster exhumation, can be more simply explained by the lateral cooling effect of topographic relief, with samples exhumed in valleys displaying a different near-surface cooling history to those on ridge crests.},

@article{Mangold2012,
 abstract = {The fan deposit in Eberswalde crater has been interpreted as strong evidence for sustained liquid water on early Mars with a paleolake formed during the Noachian period (3.7. Gy). This location became a key region for understanding the Mars paleo-environment. Eberswalde crater is located 50. km north of the rim of the 150. km diameter crater Holden. Stratigraphic relationships and chronology obtained using recent Mars Express High Resolution Stereo Camera and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Context Camera images show that Eberswalde fluvial activity crosscuts Holden ejecta and thus postdates Holden crater, whose formation age is estimated from crater counts as Late Hesperian (̃3.5. Gy, depending on models). Fluvial modeling shows that short term activity (over several years to hundreds of years) involving dense flows (with sediment:water ratio between 0.01 and 0.3) may be as good an explanation of the fluvial landforms as dilute flow over longer durations. Modeling of the thermal effect of the Holden impact in the Eberswalde watershed is used to evaluate its potential role in aqueous activity. The relative timing of the Holden impact and Eberswalde's fan is a constraint for future studies about the origin of these landforms. Holden ejecta form a weak and porous substrate, which may be easy to erode by fluvial incision. In a cold climate scenario, impact heating could have produced runoff by melting snow or ground ice. Any attempt to model fluvial activity at Eberswalde should take into account that it may have formed as late as in the Late Hesperian, after the great majority of valley network formation and aqueous mineralization on Mars. This suggests that hypotheses for fan formation at Eberswalde by transient and/or localized processes (i.e. impact, volcanism, unusual orbital forcing) should be considered on a par with globally warmer climate. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Mangold2012a,
 abstract = {Impact craters cover a large portion of the surface of Mars and could constitute a significant exobiology research target as their formation provided heat sources for aqueous processes. To date, only rare examples of hydrothermal alteration in craters have been reported on Mars while many studies have focused on modeling their effect. Using data from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and Mars Express probes, we report the presence of hydrated minerals, mainly Fe/Mg phyllosilicates, with vermiculite as best-fit, that are found in an alluvial fan. This fan is located inside a crater located in NE Hellas region and dated to the Late Hesperian by crater counts and crosscutting relationships. The stratigraphic position of the hydrated minerals and presence of small domes interpreted as hydrothermal vents indicate that the alteration occurred in the lower level of the alluvial fan and was triggered by bottom-up alteration. These observations are best explained by a combination of snow deposition and subsequent melting eroding crater rims and forming the fan, with impact warming, which triggered the alteration at the base of the fan. This example shows that phyllosilicates are able to form late in the Martian history, especially in local niches of strong exobiological interest. It also suggests that a similar process was possible in alluvial fans of other large impact craters including those at Gale crater. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The weighted and structured total least squares problems have no such analytic solution and are currently solved numerically by local optimization methods. We explain how special structure of the weight matrix and the data matrix can be exploited for efficient cost function and first derivative computation. This allows to obtain computationally efficient solution methods. The total least squares family of methods has a wide range of applications in system theory, signal processing, and computer algebra.

 abstract = {The late Precambrian Damara Supergroup was deposited in a geosyncline. There is good evidence that the intracratonic branch of this geosyncline began its development with a stage of rifting which produced three widely spaced grabens in sialic crust. During a second stage of subsidence the grabens merged and formed a geosyncline. A third stage produced intense deformation associated with thrusting and nappe transport, high-grade metamorphism, anatexis and large-scale granodioritic to granitic plutonism. A discussion of lifely geodynamic interpretations leads to the conclusion that the development of the intracratonic geosyncline can be best explained by a multiple aulacogen model. The dynamics of the orogeny cannot be readily interpreted with the help of a plate tectonic subduction-collision model. Concepts based on Ramberg's (1972) gravitational instability models are considered applicable. The hypothesis is advanced that grabens, aulacogens and mobile belts may represent diverse responses of the crust to astenoliths of different sizes.},

 abstract = {The High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) acquired 8 terapixels of data in 9137 images of Mars between October 2006 and December 2008, covering ∼0.55\% of the surface. Images are typically 5-6 km wide with 3-color coverage over the central 20\% of the swath, and their scales usually range from 25 to 60 cm/pixel. Nine hundred and sixty stereo pairs were acquired and more than 50 digital terrain models (DTMs) completed; these data have led to some of the most significant science results. New methods to measure and correct distortions due to pointing jitter facilitate topographic and change-detection studies at sub-meter scales. Recent results address Noachian bedrock stratigraphy, fluvially deposited fans in craters and in or near Valles Marineris, groundwater flow in fractures and porous media, quasi-periodic layering in polar and non-polar deposits, tectonic history of west Candor Chasma, geometry of clay-rich deposits near and within Mawrth Vallis, dynamics of flood lavas in the Cerberus Palus region, evidence for pyroclastic deposits, columnar jointing in lava flows, recent collapse pits, evidence for water in well-preserved impact craters, newly discovered large rayed craters, and glacial and periglacial processes. Of particular interest are ongoing processes such as those driven by the wind, impact cratering, avalanches of dust and/or frost, relatively bright deposits on steep gullied slopes, and the dynamic seasonal processes over polar regions. HiRISE has acquired hundreds of large images of past, present and potential future landing sites and has contributed to scientific and engineering studies of those sites. Warming the focal-plane electronics prior to imaging has mitigated an instrument anomaly that produces bad data under cold operating conditions. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.},

 abstract = {The Zambian Copperbelt is arguably the most significantly mineralized Neoproterozoic basin on Earth, preserving a truly spectacular scale of mineralization: in excess of 1 × 109 t of ore at 2.7\% copper has been extracted to date, and there are also major cobalt accumulations. The origin of these deposits has been hotly debated for more than six decades, yet the driving forces that generated this system are poorly understood, in particular the relationships between tectonics, paleo–fluid circulation, and ore deposition. We present new field and isotopic data for the Nchanga deposits in which the bulk of the mineralization is hosted by shale-capped feldspathic arenites and arkoses that have undergone recrystallization and hydrothermal alteration within a host-rock package controlled by low-angle thrust faults. By using in situ laser combustion, we show for the first time that the range of δ34S for copper-cobalt ore sulfides (−1‰ to +18‰) cannot have the same source as diagenetic pyrite (−1‰ to −17‰). We suggest a new epigenetic model for the formation of these spectacular Nchanga orebodies that involves the introduction of metal- and sulfate-bearing hydrothermal fluids into quartzofeldspathic units during basin inversion, with sulfide derived from thermochemical reduction of the sulfate near the site of deposition.},

@article{MCLENNAN2012,
 abstract = {Mars has an extensive, long-lived sedimentary record that is complimentary to the terrestrial record, bearing both first-order similarities and first-order differences. The igneous record is composed of basaltic rocks, in fundamental contrast to the granodioritic upper continental crust of the Earth, which in turn dominates the provenance of clastic and chemical sedimentary rocks. The crust and sedimentary mass of Mars on average are older than the terrestrial records, and Mars provides exceptional potential for understanding processes thatwere active during the earliest history (.3.5 Gyr) of the solar system. Numerous sedimentary minerals have been identified both from orbit and by rovers/landers and include a variety of clays, sulfates, amorphous silica, minor carbonates, and possibly chlorides. The Martian sedimentary mineralogical record is Fe- and Mg-enriched and Na- and K-depleted compared to the terrestrial record, reflecting differing crustal compositions and differing aqueous surficial environments. There is evidence for three distinct sedimentary mineralogical epochs: an early clay-rich era, intermediate sulfate-rich era, and a younger era dominated by secondary iron oxides. This mineralogical evolution likely records desiccation, acidification, and oxidation of the surface over geological time. There is also evidence that surficial processes were controlled by a sulfur cycle, rather than the carbon cycle, over much of Martian geological time, leading to low-pH aqueous conditions. The nature of this S cycle changed over time as volcanic sulfur sources and amounts of near-surface water diminished. There is a linkage between the S cycle and iron/oxygen cycles related to diagenetic oxidation of iron sulfates to form iron oxides. Where studied in detail, weathering is dominated by low pH, with mobility of ferric iron being common. Lack of evidence for expected aluminum mobility indicates that low water–rock ratio conditions prevailed. In Noachian terrains, where clay minerals are common, it is more likely that aqueous conditions were closer to circum-neutral, but detailed study awaits future landed missions. Numerous depositional environments are recognized, including fluvial, deltaic, lacustrine, eolian, and glacial settings. Evaporitic rocks appear common and are characterized by distinctive suites of Mg-, Ca-, and Fe-sulfates and possibly chlorides.Asystem of chemical divides can be constructed and indicates that the range of observed evaporite minerals can be explained by typical water compositions derived from acidic weathering of Martian crust, and with variable initial pH controlled by HCO? 3 /SO2?4 ratios. Several diagenetic processes have also been identified, including complex groundwater diagenetic histories. One process, consistent with experimental studies, that explains the correlation between sulfate and iron oxide minerals seen from orbit, as well as formation of hematitic concretions in the Burns Formation on Meridiani Planum, is oxidation of iron sulfates to form iron oxides. In general, the diagenetic record that has been identified, including incomplete iron sulfate oxidation, limited clay mineral transformations, and absence of amorphous silica recrystallization, indicates highly water-limited postdepositional conditions. Among the most important outstanding questions for sedimentary geochemistry are those related to the quantification of the size and lithological distribution of the sedimentary record, the detailed history of near-surface water, and the origin and history of acidity in the aqueous environment.},

 abstract = {Sedimentary rocks examined by the Curiosity rover at Yellowknife Bay, Mars, were derived from sources that evolved from an approximately average martian crustal composition to one influenced by alkaline basalts. No evidence of chemical weathering is preserved, indicating arid, possibly cold, paleoclimates and rapid erosion and deposition. The absence of predicted geochemical variations indicates that magnetite and phyllosilicates formed by diagenesis under low-temperature, circumneutral pH, rock-dominated aqueous conditions. Analyses of diagenetic features (including concretions, raised ridges, and fractures) at high spatial resolution indicate that they are composed of iron- and halogen-rich components, magnesium-iron-chlorine-rich components, and hydrated calcium sulfates, respectively. Composition of a cross-cutting dike-like feature is consistent with sedimentary intrusion. The geochemistry of these sedimentary rocks provides further evidence for diverse depositional and diagenetic sedimentary environments during the early history of Mars.},

This plateau would have been supported by a thick (70 km) crustal root, which is proposed to have been the source region for hot and weak mid-crustal material that flowed eastward from the plateau toward the low-elevation proto-Colorado Plateau.},

 abstract = {Deformation of sedimentary rocks is widespread within Valles Marineris, characterized by both plastic and brittle deformation identified in Candor, Melas, and Ius Chasmata. We identified four deformation styles using HiRISE and CTX images: kilometer-scale convolute folds, detached slabs, folded strata, and pull-apart structures. Convolute folds are detached rounded slabs of material with alternating dark- and light-toned strata and a fold wavelength of about 1 km. The detached slabs are isolated rounded blocks of material, but they exhibit only highly localized evidence of stratification. Folded strata are composed of continuously folded layers that are not detached. Pull-apart structures are composed of stratified rock that has broken off into small irregularly shaped pieces showing evidence of brittle deformation. Some areas exhibit multiple styles of deformation and grade from one type of deformation into another. The deformed rocks are observed over thousands of kilometers, are limited to discrete stratigraphic intervals, and occur over a wide range in elevations. All deformation styles appear to be of likely thin-skinned origin. CRISM reflectance spectra show that some of the deformed sediments contain a component of monohydrated and polyhydrated sulfates. Several mechanisms could be responsible for the deformation of sedimentary rocks in Valles Marineris, such as subaerial or subaqueous gravitational slumping or sliding and soft sediment deformation, where the latter could include impact-induced or seismically induced liquefaction. These mechanisms are evaluated based on their expected pattern, scale, and areal extent of deformation. Deformation produced from slow subaerial or subaqueous landsliding and liquefaction is consistent with the deformation observed in Valles Marineris.},

 abstract = {Diverse phyllosilicate deposits discovered previously in the Nili Fossae region with near infrared reflectance data are a window into the complex history of aqueous alteration on Mars. In this work, we used thermal infrared data from the Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES) in combination with near infrared data from the Observatoire pour la Minéralogie, l'Eau, les Glaces, et l'Activité (OMEGA) to better constrain the mineralogy and geologic origin of these deposits. We developed a TES spectral index for identification of clay minerals, which correctly identifies the phyllosilicates in the Nili Fossae area and points to several other interesting deposits in the Syrtis Major region. However, detailed inspection of the TES spectral features of Nili Fossae phyllosilicates shows a feature at low wavenumbers (350-550 cm-1) that is not an exact match to any specific Fe3+-, Al-, or Mg-rich phyllosilicate phase. Instead, the feature is more similar to basaltic glass and may indicate that the phyllosilicates in this region are: (1) rich in Fe2+(based on similarity to trends seen in laboratory data of clay minerals), (2) poorly crystalline/extremely disordered, and/or (3) present within a matrix of actual basalt glass. This feature is similar to spectral features seen in altered rocks in the Columbia Hills region of Gusev Crater by previous authors. By calibrating measured spectral index values against mathematical spectral mixtures of typical martian dark surfaces and known abundances of alteration minerals, we are able to estimate an enrichment in abundance of alteration minerals in the altered surfaces. Many dark, Noachian deposits in the Nili Fossae area are enriched phyllosilicates by 20-30\% (±10-15\%) relative to dark, volcanic surfaces in the same region. The distribution and abundance of these phases indicates that alteration in the region was pervasive, but did not completely erase the original mineralogy of what was likely an Fe-rich basalt protolith. As a group, the Nili Fossae phyllosilicate deposits are fundamentally different from those found in the Mawrth Vallis region. Nili Fossae deposits have strong thermal infrared features related to admixed pyroxene, plagioclase, and occasionally olivine, whereas the Mawrth Vallis deposits contain no mafic minerals. Comparison of TES and OMEGA data also illustrates some more general differences between the datasets, including the impact of physical character of the martian surface on detectability of minerals in each spectral range. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

 abstract = {1 R. M. MITCHUM, JR., P. R. VAIL, 2 and S. THOMPSON, III 3 Abstract A depositional sequence is a stratigraphic unit composed of a relatively conformable succession of genetically related strata and bounded at its top and base by unconformities or their correlative conformi-ties. This concept of a "sequence" is modified from Sloss. A depositional sequence is determined by a single objective criterion, the physical relations of the strata themselves. The combination of objective deter-mination of sequence boundaries and the systematic patterns of deposition of the genetically related strata within sequences makes the sequence concept a fun-damental and extremely practical basis for the interpre-tation of stratigraphy and depositional facies. Because distribution and facies of many sequences are con-trolled by global changes of sea level, sequences also provide an ideal basis for establishing comprehensive stratigraphic frameworks on regional or global scales. A depositional sequence is chronostratigraphically significant because it was deposited during a given in-terval of geologic time limited by ages of the sequence boundaries where the boundaries are conformities; however the age range of the strata within the se-quence may differ from place to place where the boundaries are unconformities. The hiatus along the unconformable part of a sequence boundary generally is variable in duration. The hiatus along the conform-able part is not measureable, and the surface is practi-cally synchronous. Stratal surfaces within a sequence are essentially synchronous in terms of geologic time. Depositional sequences may range in thickness from hundreds of meters to a few centimeters. Sequences of different magnitudes may be recognized on seismic sections, well-log sections, and surface outcrops. To define and correlate a depositional sequence ac-curately, the sequence boundaries must be defined and traced precisely. Usually the boundaries are de-fined at unconformities and traced to their correlative conformities. Discordance of strata is the main crite-rion used in the determination of sequence bound-aries, and the type of discordant relation is the best indicator of whether an unconformity results from ero-sion or nondeposition. Onlap, downlap, and toplap in-dicate nondepositional hiatuses; truncation indicates an erosional hiatus unless the truncation is a result of structural disruption. Examples of depositional sequences are presented on well-log and seismic sections. Both examples depend primarily on correlation of physical stratigraphic surfaces for identification of the unconformities bound-ing the sequences, and on biostratigraphic zonation for determination of the geologic ages of the sequences.},

 abstract = {Evidence is presented to model drainage evolution across Zimbabwe since the Permian. This provides the framework to understand the marked difference in character of the rivers to the north and south of the modern central Zimbabwe watershed, which separates the Zambezi and Limpopo drainage basins. North-flowing tributaries of the Zambezi rising off this river divide have low gradients and senile characteristics. The northwest orientation of the upper sections of many of these rivers is unusual for tributaries of a major east- flowing drainage, but is in accord with the west-orientated fluvial system that deposited the Triassic sediments of the Karoo Supergroup in the Cabora Bassa basin of the Zambezi Valley. The modern drainage system to the north of the central Zimbabwe watershed is thus largely controlled by a surface that has existed since pre-Karoo times. Headwaters of the Zambezi tributaries were originally located well to the south of the modern divide, with high ground extending to the present-day Chimanimani and Nyanga mountainland in eastern Zimbabwe. This drainage system persisted until the late Triassic, when rifting, linked to the early disruption of Gondwana, initiated the formation of the modern Save and Zambezi river systems. The central Zimbabwe watershed represents a late Palaeogene (̃43 to 33 Ma) asymmetric epeirogenic flexure, part of the Ovamboland-Kalahari-Zimbabwe Axis, which beheaded the headwaters of the early Zambezi tributaries. The resultant steeper gradients to the south of the watershed initiated the modern youthful south-flowing drainage system. A further disruption to the Zambezi drainage system occurred during Plio-Pleistocene arid episodes, when major dunes developed across dry river systems such as the Shangani, in the northwest of the country. Renewed flow in these rivers during subsequent wetter pluvial episodes resulted in them exploiting the inter-dune streets to develop new courses. Some, like the Shangani, incised their courses through the Kalahari sand cover to become superimposed drainages. The landscape of much of Zimbabwe reflects the imprint of two major cycles of erosion (African and post-African) since the disruption of Gondwana. The African erosion cycle commenced with the disruption of Gondwana, while the ensuing post-African cycle of erosion was initiated by the late Palaeogene uplift along the line of the modern central watershed. This rejuvenated the river network, leading to removal of the carapace of deeply weathered saprolite that developed under the humid mid-Cretaceous climate of the earlier African cycle. The post-African surface is thus an etch surface, with the characteristic plain and inselberg topography marking the weathering base of the African erosion event. A very subordinate Plio-Pleistocene cycle is reflected by terraces immediately marginal to the major river systems. The confinement of the Save and Zambezi drainages to graben structures resulted in their evolution largely independently of the two major erosion cycles that moulded the landscape of the rest of the country. The palaeo-drainage reconstruction has important implications for the dispersion of diamonds and associated pathfinder minerals from primary kimberlite sources. The Sese-Murowa kimberlites are inferred to be the primary source of hitherto unexplained alluvial diamonds in basal gravels of the Somabula Karoo outlier, located on the central Zimbabwe watershed, some 120 km to the northwest. The drainage evolution model also provides a framework to infer likely distal kimberlite sources for a number of major unexplained kimberlitic pathfinder mineral anomalies associated with the southern margin of the Kalahari Formation.},

 abstract = {In a continuous binary solution, the partition coefficient, expressed as a ratio of mole fractions of one component in two phases, is linear against the composition of one of the phases (the numerator phase) if the exchange coefficient K(D) is constant. Linearity is found in some distilling liquids, many silicate and metal alloy melts, and many mineral pairs at high pressure. Its presence facilitates the determination and analysis of phase diagrams, calculations of Rayleigh fractionation, and applications ranging from criteria for explosive volcanism to phase equilibria in the deep interior of the Earth. The rules for linear partitioning are completely mathematical. When empirically found, linearity shows the constancy of K(D) and permits the inference of some thermodynamic properties of the solutions. Ideality of solutions contributes strongly to linearity, but some nonideal solutions, notably azeotropes, are routinely found to be linear. This presentation is devoted to empirical examples of linear and nonlinear partitioning, and an exploration of their causes and effects. The reasons for linearity in nonideal solutions are poorly understood. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

 abstract = {Many mantle peridotites exhumed along ancient and present-day magma-poor passive continental margins, along (ultra-) slow spreading ridges and fracture zones are plagioclase-bearing and generally too fertile to be the residue of partial melting processes alone. Likewise, the associated gabbroic and basaltic rocks are not a priori genetically linked to the underlying mantle rocks. Trace element and Nd isotopic studies in the eastern Central Alps peridotites in eastern Switzerland and northern Italy provide evidence for near-fractional melting and depletion at high pressure in Permian time followed by refertilization of subcontinental mantle by ascending melts at low pressure in Jurassic time. These results suggest regional-scale modification of ancient subcontinental mantle by melt infiltration and melt-rock reaction during incipient opening of oceanic basins. The similar Nd isotopic composition of plagioclase peridotite (εNd160: 7.4-10.6) and associated mafic crust (εNd160: 7.3-9.6) indicates that the liquids, which reacted with the peridotites derived from similar N-MORB type mantle sources. Plagioclase peridotites in magma-poor passive margins may predominantly form as a consequence of diffuse porous flow of melt in the thermal boundary layer above an upwelling asthenosphere and probably represent modified ancient subcontinental mantle. Thus, plagioclase peridotites exhumed in passive margins and possibly in (ultra-) slow spreading ridges may represent magma-poor periods where liquids stagnate in the thermal boundary layer and react with the surrounding peridotites. Once the effects of conductive heat loss dominate over advection of heat from below, diffuse porous flow of melt becomes less important and might be replaced by the formation of gabbro bodies. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

 abstract = {New results from the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars and High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment and Context Imager cameras on Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter provide insights into the origin of interior layered deposits in Valles Marineris from analysis of a thick, well-exposed section in western Candor Chasma. Most of the deposit is dominated spectrally by nanophase ferric oxide like that found in the globally distributed eolian dust, with the addition of a prevalent component of monohydrated sulfates. A rippled mantle containing both pyroxene and monohydrated sulfate emanates from discrete layers, which are interpreted as interbedded basaltic sand. Ferric minerals are observed in most of the sulfate-rich layers, and locally a coarse-grained grayer component has been concentrated from the layers by sorting. Polyhydrated sulfates are concentrated in discrete layers high in the section, implying chasma-scale changes in brine chemistry during formation of the layered deposits. Hydrological models were constructed in order to assess whether evaporite deposition from groundwater discharge could have trapped eolian sediments to form the observed deposits. The predicted thickness and extent of the evaporite-trapped sediment is consistent with the distribution of interior layered deposits in Candor Chasma as well as in other chasmata of Valles Marineris. In this scenario, eolian dust and sand were trapped and lithified by evaporites formed by evaporation of groundwater discharge that was highly localized within the chasmata. Sulfates precipitated in the resulting saline conditions, and diagenetic alteration formed crystalline ferric minerals including hematite. This model links the layered deposits in Valles Marineris and those in Meridiani Planum to a common regional process.},

Olivine- and HCP-rich regions are found in deposits that span the age range of geologic units. However, LCP-rich regions are found only in the ancient Noachian-aged units, which suggests that melts for these deposits were derived from a mantle depleted in aluminum and calcium. Extended dark regions in the northern plains exhibit no evidence of strong mafic absorptions or absorptions due to hydrated materials.},

 abstract = {Variations in calcareous nannofossil assemblages from both low and high palaeolatitudes of the late Aptian - early Albian Suggest a global cooling. Significant shifts include a decline of Tethyan taxa and a subsequent biogeographic expansion of species of high latitudinal affinities. This cooling is Supported by sedimentological observations (glendonites, ice rafted debris) and oxygen isotope data. The first phase of decreasing surface water temperatures is indicated by a marked decline of Tethyan nannoconids in the late Aptian at both high and low latitudinal sites. This is paralleled by an increase of the cool water nannofossil species Crucibiscutum salebrosum and a biogeographic expansion of the high latitudinal nannofossil taxon Repagulum parvidentatum. The biogeographic expansion of high latitudinal nannofossil cold water belts in the northern and southern hemisphere is followed by the first common Occurrence of diatoms in the high latitudes. This onset of siliceous phytoplankton marks the second phase of the cooling. Diatoms Occur simultaneously both in the high latitudes of the northern and southern hemisphere, suggesting a global climatic cooling. This scenario requires flow and exchange Of Surface waters from the high latitudes. The Equatorial Atlantic Seaway between Africa and South America came into existence only in the late Aptian - Albian allowing for all exchange of biota. If the scenario of cold polar regions in the late Aptian - early Albian is valid, this Must have had also consequences for the formation and flow of cold oceanic deep waters. Our findings Suggest a much more complex climatic history of the 30 Ma lasting Aptian - Turonian greenhouse period than previously thought. This period was obviously punctured by at least one icehouse interlude in the late Aptian - early Albian interval, which effected the evolution of, primary producers severely.},

 abstract = {Mafic complexes in the central Sierra Nevada batholith record valuable geochemical information regarding the role mafic magmas play in arc magmatism and the generation of continental crust. In the intrusive suite of Yosemite Valley, major and trace element compositions of the hornblende-bearing gabbroic rocks from the Rockslides mafic complex and of the mafic dikes in the North America Wall are compositionally similar to high-alumina basalt. Of these rocks, two samples have higher Ni and Cr abundances as well as higher εNd values than previously recognized for the intrusive suite. Plagioclase crystals in rocks from the North America Wall and the Rockslides have prominent calcic cores and sharply defined sodic rims, a texture commonly associated with mixing of mafic and felsic magmas. In situ analyses of 87Sr/86Sr in plagioclase show no significant isotopic difference from the cores to the rims of these grains. We propose that the high 87Sr/86Sr (̃0.7067) and low εNd (̃−3.4) of bulk rocks, the homogeneity of 87Sr/86Sr in plagioclase, and the high δ18O values of bulk rocks (6.6–7.3 ‰) and zircon (Lackey et al. in J Petrol 49:1397–1426, 2008) demonstrate that continental crust was assimilated into the sublithospheric mantle-derived basaltic precursors of the mafic rocks in Yosemite Valley. Contamination (20–40 \%) likely occurred in the lower crust as the magma differentiated to high-alumina basalt prior to plagioclase (and zircon) crystallization. As a consequence, the isotopic signatures recorded by whole rocks, plagioclase, and zircon do not represent the composition of the underlying lithospheric mantle. We conclude that the mafic and associated felsic members of the intrusive suite of Yosemite Valley represent 60–80 \% new additions to the crust and include significant quantities of recycled ancient crust.},

 abstract = {Reprocessed deep-penetration seismic reflection profiles across the offshore southern Santa Maria Basin suggest a complex history of tectonic deformation. The top of subducted oceanic crust, imaged at the north end of EDGE line RU-10, is disrupted and eventually disappears to the south. Farther south, a strong lower crustal reflection ramps up and may reflect a possible north-dipping low-angle detachment, or a change in crustal geometry associated with the subducted Morro Fracture Zone. Above a time-transgressive unconformity, Miocene and younger sediments onlap to the south and water bottom deepens, suggesting a major regional tilt reversal in post-Miocene time. Below the unconformity, basement is displaced by largely northwest-striking normal faults that we believe form tilted crustal blocks; it is possible that Cretaceous and Paleogene sections are preserved in resulting half-grabens. Some of these normal faults, including splays off the outer Santa Lucia Bank fault system, were reactivated as minor reverse faults in post-Miocene time. There is no evidence that requires any post-17.5 Ma tectonostratigraphic terrane boundary through this area; rather, much of the structure of the southern Santa Maria Basin appears to be continuous with the rotated Western Transverse Ranges and northern Channel Islands.},

 abstract = {Tectonic rotation of the western Transverse Ranges block is explained by capture of the partially subducted Monterey microplate by the Pacific plate at about anomaly 6 time (ca. 20 Ma). As Pacific-Monterey spreading slowed and eventually ceased, the slip vector along the gently northeast dipping subduction interface beneath the California margin changed from slightly oblique subduction to transtensional dextral transform motion. This change in slip vector and a shift of Pacific plate motion eastward along the already subducted Monterey plate interface imply that the San Andreas transform began as a system of low-angle faults that locally subjected the overriding continental margin to distributed basal shear and crustal extension. This basal shear produced the rotated western Transverse Ranges. This model helps explain the timing of initial rotation and basin formation, the sudden appearance of widely distributed transform motion well inland of the margin in early Miocene time, why the western Transverse Ranges uniquely rotated as a large coherent crustal block, and several fundamental structural characteristics of central and southern California. The model also provides major constraints on the amount of Pacific-North America strike-slip motion, the position through time of offshore oceanic plates relative to onshore geology, and a general explanation for what may happen as a spreading ridge approaches a trench and the subduction zone evolves into a transform system.},

 abstract = {The ability of terrestrial microorganisms to grow in the near-surface environment of Mars is of importance to the search for life and protection of that planet from forward contamination by human and robotic exploration. Because most water on present-day Mars is frozen in the regolith, permafrosts are considered to be terrestrial analogs of the martian subsurface environment. Six bacterial isolates were obtained from a permafrost borehole in northeastern Siberia capable of growth under conditions of low temperature (0 °C), low pressure (7 mbar), and a CO(2)-enriched anoxic atmosphere. By 16S ribosomal DNA analysis, all six permafrost isolates were identified as species of the genus Carnobacterium, most closely related to C. inhibens (five isolates) and C. viridans (one isolate). Quantitative growth assays demonstrated that the six permafrost isolates, as well as nine type species of Carnobacterium (C. alterfunditum, C. divergens, C. funditum, C. gallinarum, C. inhibens, C. maltaromaticum, C. mobile, C. pleistocenium, and C. viridans) were all capable of growth under cold, low-pressure, anoxic conditions, thus extending the low-pressure extreme at which life can function.},

 abstract = {Abyssal peridotites have been interpreted to be residues of mantle melting beneath ocean ridges. Recent experimental data and models of mantle melting allow quantitative tests of this hypothesis. The tests show that abyssal peridotites are not purely melting residues. Their modal proportions and whole-rock compositions have far more olivine than would be predicted from melting models. Nonetheless, the correlations between modal proportions of olivine and residual mineral chemistry, and the relationship between associated basalt and peridotite compositions, require an important role for melting. We suggest that abyssal peridotite compositions result from a combination of melting and crystallization processes that are both a natural response to ascent of solid and melt beneath an ocean ridge. Different extents of melting create a range of residual peridotite and mantle melt compositions. The buoyant melts migrate upwards, where they encounter the surface thermal boundary layer and crystallize olivine. The greater the ambient extent of melting of the mantle, the higher the normative olivine contents of the melt, and the more melt is produced. Hence greater extents of melting lead to more olivine crystallization at shallow levels. This correlation between melting and crystallization within the mantle preserves the observed relationships between peridotite modes and mineral compositions. Significant implications of these results are: (1) the bulk composition of the oceanic crust differs from the primary melt compositions produced by partial melting of the mantle because of olivine crystallization at the thermal boundary layer; (2) the actual thickness of igneous crust may be variably thinner than would be calculated assuming total melt extraction; and (3) peridotite modes can be used to infer polybaric mantle melting reactions only if the accumulated olivine is removed appropriately.

 abstract = {Juventae Chasma is a deep depression located north of Valles Marineris on Mars, with four bright mounds or light-toned interior layered deposits (ILDs) extending upwards from the Canyon floor. We present here the results of long-term imaging of Juventae Chasma including mounds A, B, C, and D using multiple datasets. Monohydrated sulfates (MHS) were deposited first on the canyon floor, followed by polyhydrated sulfates (PHS). The upper PHS-dominated units are largely eroded away at Juventae Chasma, but this material is still present in significant abundance at mound B. PHS are observed mixed with MHS in some areas of mounds A and C. Terraces are observed at the upper elevations of mound B that contain PHS at the steeper slopes and appear to be covered with dust on the horizontal surfaces. Current analyses of the MHS-rich unit indicate that kieserite (MgSOinf4/inf\{dot operator\}Hinf2/infO) is the primary sulfate component, rather than szomolnokite (FeSOinf4/inf\{dot operator\}Hinf2/infO) as previously thought. Formation of kieserite at Juventae Chasma likely required temperatures in the 150-200°C range. Geochemical modeling is most consistent with dissolution of mafic materials followed by precipitation of kieserite from solution. The dust exhibits ferric signatures and the sand is largely mafic material.

 abstract = {A diverse, well-preserved microbiota has been discovered in petrographic thin sections of stromatolitic black chert of the ca. 1000-1100 Ma-old Allamoore Formation from the Van Horn region of west Texas. Geologic evidence indicates that the mat-building microbial community inhabited a shallow-water environment, probably intermittently exposed to subaerial desiccation. The microfossils occur in two interlaminated sedimentary fabrics: a flat-lying to wavy stromatolitic fabric, formed during relatively quiescent periods, and an intraclastic fabric that reflects deposition in agitated water, perhaps during storms. The carbonaceous microfossils are three-dimensionally preserved, permineralized in fine-grained chert probably of early diagenetic origin. The assemblage includes solitary and colonial unicellular cyanobacteria (Entophysalidaceae or Chroococcaceae), the tubular sheaths of at least three microbial taxa (apparently of oscillatoriacean affinities), and cellular prokaryotic filaments. The common occurrence of large spheroidal unicells, some in excess of 100 ??m in diameter, suggests that fossil eukaryotes (green or red algae) may also be represented. The Allamoore cherts comprise one of only a few microfossiliferous Precambrian deposits now known from western North America. ?? 1981.},

 abstract = {The relation between the complex geological history of the western margin of the North American plate and the processes in the mantle is still not fully documented and understood. Several pre-USArray local seismic studies showed how the characteristics of key geological features such as the Colorado Plateau and the Yellowstone Snake River Plains are linked to their deep mantle structure. Recent body-wave models based on the deployment of the high density, large aperture USArray have provided far more details on the mantle structure while surface-wave tomography (ballistic waves and noise correlations) informs us on the shallow structure. Here we combine constraints from these two data sets to image and study the link between the geology of the western United States, the shallow structure of the Earth and the convective processes in mantle. Our multiphase DNA10-S model provides new constraints on the extent of the Archean lithosphere imaged as a large, deeply rooted fast body that encompasses the stable Great Plains and a large portion of the Northern and Central Rocky Mountains. Widespread slow anomalies are found in the lower crust and upper mantle, suggesting that low-density rocks isostatically sustain part of the high topography of the western United States. The Yellowstone anomaly is imaged as a large slow body rising from the lower mantle, intruding the overlying lithosphere and controlling locally the seismicity and the topography. The large E–W extent of the USArray used in this study allows imaging the ‘slab graveyard', a sequence of Farallon fragments aligned with the currently subducting Juan de Fuca Slab, north of the Mendocino Triple Junction. The lithospheric root of the Colorado Plateau has apparently been weakened and partly removed through dripping. The distribution of the slower regions around the Colorado Plateau and other rigid blocks follows closely the trend of Cenozoic volcanic fields and ancient lithospheric sutures, suggesting that the later exert a control on the locus of magmato-tectonic activity today. The DNA velocity models are available for download and slicing at http://dna.berkeley.edu.},

 abstract = {The origin of hotspot trails is controversial. Explanations range from deep mantle plumes rising from the core–mantle boundary (CMB) to shallow plate cracking. However, these mechanisms cannot explain uniquely the scattered hotspot trails distributed across a 2,000-km-wide swell in the sea floor of the southeast Atlantic Ocean. This swell projects down to one of the two largest and deepest distinct regions at the CMB, the Africa Low Shear Wave Velocity Province. Here we use 40Ar/39Ar isotopic analyses to date lava samples erupted at several hotspot trails across the Atlantic swell. We combine the eruption ages with an analysis of the structure and age of the sea floor, and find that the trails formed synchronously, in a pattern consistent with movement of the African Plate over plumes rising from the edge of the Africa Low Shear Wave Velocity Province. However, we also find that the seamounts initially formed only at the edge of the swell, where the oceanic crust was spreading apart. Later, about 44 million years ago, the hotspot trails began to cross the swell, but only in locations where the lithosphere was sufficiently young and thin that magma could reach the surface. We conclude that the distribution of hotspot trails in the southeast Atlantic Ocean is controlled by the interplay between deep-sourced mantle plumes and the motion and structure of the African Plate.},

 abstract = {This paper presents the hypothesis that the well-known giant polygons and bright mounds of the martian lowlands may be related to a common process-a process of fluid expulsion that results from burial of fine-grained sediments beneath a body of water. Specifically, we hypothesize that giant polygons and mounds in Chryse and Acidalia Planitiae are analogous to kilometer-scale polygons and mud volcanoes in terrestrial, marine basins and that the co-occurrence of masses of these features in Chryse and Acidalia may be the signature of sedimentary processes in an ancient martian ocean. We base this hypothesis on recent data from both Earth and Mars. On Earth, 3-D seismic data illustrate kilometer-scale polygons that may be analogous to the giant polygons on Mars. The terrestrial polygons form in fine-grained sediments that have been deposited and buried in passive-margin, marine settings. These polygons are thought to result from compaction/dewatering, and they are commonly associated with fluid expulsion features, such as mud volcanoes. On Mars, in Chryse and Acidalia Planitiae, orbital data demonstrate that giant polygons and mounds have overlapping spatial distributions. There, each set of features occurs within a geological setting that is seemingly analogous to that of the terrestrial, kilometer-scale polygons (broad basin of deposition, predicted fine-grained sediments, and lack of significant horizontal stress). Regionally, the martian polygons and mounds both show a correlation to elevation, as if their formation were related to past water levels. Although these observations are based on older data with incomplete coverage, a similar correlation to elevation has been established in one local area studied in detail with newer higher-resolution data. Further mapping with the latest data sets should more clearly elucidate the relationship(s) of the polygons and mounds to elevation over the entire Chryse-Acidalia region and thereby provide more insight into this hypothesis.},

Our compiled \{delta\}11B data reveal similar ocean pH patterns for all investigated cratons and confirm the presence of a global and synchronous ocean acidification event during the Marinoan deglacial period, compatible with elevated postglacial pCO2 concentrations.

 abstract = {The structural geology of an outcropping of layered sedimentary deposits in southwest Candor Chasma is mapped using two adjacent high-resolution (1m/pixel) HiRISE digital elevation models and orthoimagery. Analysis of these structural data yields new insight into the depositional and deformational history of these deposits. Bedding in non-deformed areas generally dips toward the center of west Candor Chasma, suggesting that these deposits are basin-filling sediments. Numerous kilometer-scale faults and folds characterize the deformation here. Normal faults of the requisite orientation and length for chasma-related faulting are not observed, indicating that the local sediments accumulated after chasma formation had largely ceased in this area. The cause of the observed deformation is attributed to landsliding within these sedimentary deposits. Observed crosscutting relationships indicate that a population of sub-vertical joints are the youngest deformational structures in the area. The distribution of strain amongst these joints, and an apparently youthful infill of sediment, suggests that these fractures have been active in the recent past. The source of the driving stress acting on these joints has yet to be fully constrained, but the joint orientations are consistent with minor subsidence within west Candor Chasma.},

Application of the Bingham density function to paleomagnetic poles from Tertiary lava flows in Iceland reveals temporal fluctuations in the eccentricity of the data. Use of the Bingham density function in the analysis of intersecting great circles is illustrated by application to data from a lightning strike remagnetized basalt in northern Arizona.},

 abstract = {The proton microprobe has been used to determine contents of Ca, Ti, Ni, Mn and Zn in the olivine of 54 spinel lherzolite xenoliths from Australian and Chinese basalts. These data are compared with proton-probe data for Ni, Mn and Zn in the olivine of 180 garnet peridotite xenoliths from African and Siberian kimberlites. Fe, Mn, Ni and Zn contents are well-correlated; because the spinel lherzolite olivines have higher mean Fe contents than garnet peridotite olivines (average Fo (sub 89.6) vs. Fo (sub 90-92) ) they also have lower Ni and higher Mn contents. Zn and Fe are well-correlated in garnet peridotite olivine, but in spinel peridotites this relationship is perturbed by partitioning of Zn into spinel. None of these elements shows significant correlation with temperature. Consistent differences in trace-element contents of olivines in the two suites is interpreted as reflecting the greater degree of depletion of Archean garnet peridotites as compared to Phanerozoic spinel lherzolites. Ca and Ti contents of spinel-peridotite olivine are well correlated with one another, and with temperature as determined by several types of geothermometer. However, Ca contents are poorly correlated with pressure as determined by the Ca-in-olivine barometer of Koehler and Brey (1990). This reflects the strong T-dependence of this barometer: the uncertainty in pressure (calculated by this method) which is produced by the + or -50 degrees C uncertainty expected of any geothermometer is ca + or -8 kbar, corresponding to the entire width of the spinel-lherzolite field at 900-1200 degrees C.},

 abstract = {High-resolution global seismic tomography (Vs) models reveal high-velocity domains beneath cratonic crust in Africa that extend to depths of 300-400??km. These high-velocity domains show a distinct contrast with the characteristics of "normal" asthenosphere and are interpreted as depleted, buoyant roots that formed in the Archean and have been metasomatised over time, but have remained attached to the overlying crust. Such deep roots are impediments to free horizontal convection in the upper mantle. The movement of magmas and other fluids in such regions may be more vertically constrained (a shallow lava lamp regime), creating a geodynamic environment conducive to interaction of such magmas with the boundaries of deep mantle domains that would carry old "crustal" geochemical signatures. The tomographic models and the new world magnetic-anomaly map show that these continental roots, overlain by thinned continental crust, locally extend well out under the deep Atlantic Ocean basin. However, such high-velocity domains are not confined to the basin margins, but are scattered randomly through the basin, some quite distant from the continental margins of South America and Africa. These high-velocity domains are interpreted to be remnant lithospheric fragments isolated by disruption of the ancient continental regions during rifting. This interpretation is supported by the old Os depletion ages of mantle peridotites from mid-ocean ridges and oceanic islands. Basaltic magmas near such high-velocity domains carry the geochemical signatures (EM1, EM2) of interaction with refertilised cratonic mantle. The interaction of rising magmas with fragments of ancient lithospheric mantle can explain such geochemical signatures and obviates the need for complex models in which these geochemical reservoirs are isolated and preserved in the convecting mantle. ?? 2009.},

 abstract = {The lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB) represents the base of the Earth's lithosphere, the rigid and relatively cool outer shell characterised by a conductive thermal regime, isolated from the convecting asthenosphere. Chemically, the LAB should divide a lithospheric mantle that is variably depleted in basaltic components from a more fertile asthenosphere. In xenolith suites from cratonic areas, the bottom of the depleted lithosphere is marked by a rapid downward increase in elements such as Fe, Ca, Al, Ti, Zr and Y, and a rapid decrease in the median Mg\# of olivine, reflecting the infiltration of mafic melts and related fluids. Eclogites and related mafic and carbonatitic crystallisation products are concentrated at the same depths as the maximum degrees of metasomatism, and may represent the melts responsible for this refertilisation of the lithosphere. This refertilised zone, at depths of ca 170-220. km beneath Archean and Proterozoic cratons, is unlikely to represent a true LAB. Re-Os isotopic studies of the deepest fertile peridotite xenoliths show that they retain evidence of ancient depletion events; seismic tomography data show high-velocity material extending to much greater depths beneath cratons. The cratonic "LAB" probably represents a level where asthenospheric melts have ponded and refertilised the lithosphere, rather than marking a transition to the convecting asthenosphere. Our only deeper samples are rare diamond inclusions and some xenoliths inverted from majoritic garnet, which are unlikely to represent the bulk composition of the asthenosphere.In younger continental regions the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary is shallower (commonly at about 80-100. km). In regions of extension and lithosphere thinning (e.g. eastern China, eastern Australia, Mongolia), upwelling asthenosphere may cool to form the lowermost lithosphere, and may be represented by xenoliths of fertile garnet peridotites in alkali basalts. The LAB is a movable boundary. It may become shallower due to thermal and chemical erosion of the lithosphere, assisted by extension. Refertilised lithospheric sections, especially where peridotites are intermixed with eclogite, may be capable of gravitational delamination. The lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary may also be deepened by subcretion of upwelling hot mantle (e.g. plumes). This process may be recorded in the strongly layered lithospheric mantle sections seen in the Slave Craton (Canada), northern Michigan (USA) and the Gawler Craton (Australia). © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

@phdthesis{OsburnIsotopicproxiesmicrobial2013,
 abstract = {Microbes have profoundly influenced the Earth’s environments through time. Records of these interactions come primarily from the development and implementation of proxies that relate known modern processes to chemical signatures in the sedimentary record.  This thesis is presented in two parts, focusing first on novel proxy development in the modern and second on interpretation of past environments using well-established methods.  Part 1, presented in two chapters, builds on previous observations that different microbial metabolisms produce vastly different lipid hydrogen isotopic compositions.  Chapter 1 evaluates the potential environmental expression of metabolism-based fractionation differences by exploiting the natural microbial community gradients in hydrothermal springs.  We find a very large range in isotopic composition that can be demonstrably linked to the microbial source(s) of the fatty acids at each sample site. In Chapter 2, anaerobic culturing techniques are used to evaluate the hydrogen isotopic fractionations produced by anaerobic microbial metabolisms.  Although the observed fractionation patterns are similar to those reported for aerobic cultures for some organisms, others show large differences.  Part 2 changes focus from the modern to the ancient and uses classical stratigraphic methods combined with isotope stratigraphy to interpret microbial and environmental changes during the latest Precambrian Era.  Chapter 3 presents a detailed characterization of the facies, parasequence development, and stratigraphic architecture of the Ediacaran Khufai Formation. Chapter 4 presents measurements of carbon, oxygen, and sulfur isotopic ratios in stratigraphic context.  Large oscillations in the isotopic composition of sulfate constrain the size of the marine sulfate reservoir and suggest incorporation of an enriched isotopic source.  Because this data was measured in stratigraphic context, we can assert with confidence that these isotopic shifts are not related to stratigraphic surfaces or facies type but instead reflect the evolution of the ocean through time.  This data integrates into the chemostratigraphic global record and contributes to the emerging picture of changing marine chemistry during the latest Precambrian Era.},

@article{Oswald2002,
 abstract = {The Hunter Mountain fault zone strikes northwesterly, is right-lateral strike-slip, and kinematically links the northern Panamint Valley fault zone to the southern Saline Valley fault zone. The most recent displacement of the fault is recorded in the offset of Holocene deposits along the entire length of the fault zone. Right-lateral offsets of drainage channels within Grapevine Canyon reach up to 50 to 60 m. Initial incision of the offset channels is interpreted on the basis of geomorphic and climatic considerations to have occurred approximately 15 ka. The 50 to 60 m of offset during 15 ka corresponds to a right-lateral fault slip rate of 3.3-4.0 mm/year within Grapevine Canyon. Further to the north along the Nelson Range front, the fault is composed of two sub-parallel fault strands and the fault begins to show an increased normal component of motion. A channel margin that is incised into a Holocene surface that is between 10 and 128 ka in age is offset 16-20 m, which yields a broad minimum bound on the lateral slip rate of 0.125-2.0 mm/year. The best preserved single-event displacements recorded in Holocene deposits range from 1.5 to 2.5 m. In addition to faulting within Grapevine Canyon and the main rangefront fault along the southwest edge of Saline Valley, there also exist normal fault strands within the Valley that strike northeasterly and towards Eureka Valley. The northeasterly striking normal faults in the Valley appear to be actively transferring dextral slip from the Hunter Mountain fault zone north and east onto the Furnace Creek fault zone. Separations on northerly trending, normal faults within Saline Valley yield estimates of slip rates in the hundredths of millimeters per year. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

 abstract = {Epigenetic gorges form when channels that have been laterally displaced during episodes of river blockage or aggradation incise down into bedrock spurs or side-walls of the former valley rather than excavating unconsolidated fills and reinhabiting the buried paleovalley. Valley-filling events that promote epigenetic gorges can be localized, such as a landslide dam or an alluvial/debris flow fan deposit at a tributary junction, or widespread, such as fluvial aggradation in response to climate change or fluctuating base-level. The formation of epigenetic gorges depends upon the competition between the resistance to transport, strength and rough- ness of valley-filling sediments and a river's ability to sculpt and incise bedrock. The former affects the location and lateral mobility of a channel incising into valley-filling deposits; the latter determines rates of bedrock incision should the path of the incising channel intersect with bedrock that is not the paleovalley bottom. Epigenetic gorge incision, by definition, post-dates the incision that originally cut the valley. Strath terraces and sculpted bedrock walls that form in relation to epigenetic gorges should not be used to directly infer river incision induced by tectonic activity or climate variability. Rather, they are indicative of the variability of short- term bedrock river incision and autogenic dynamics of actively incising fluvial landscapes. The rate of bedrock incision associated with an epigenetic gorge can be very high (1 cm/yr), typically orders of magnitude higher than both short- and long-term landscape denudation rates. In the context of bedrock river incision and landscape evolution, epigenetic gorges force rivers to incise more bedrock, slowing long-term incision and delaying the adjustment of rivers to regional tectonic and climatic forcing.},

Thermal model calculations show that, despite Mercury's proximity to the sun, the temperatures of flat, low-reflectivity surfaces at Mercury's poles are not expected to exceed 167 kelvin. The locations of the anomalous polar radar features appear to be correlated with the locations of large, high-latitude impact craters. Maximum surface temperatures in the permanently shadowed regions of these craters are expected to be significantly colder, as low as 60 kelvin in the largest craters. These results are consistent with the presence of water ice, because at temperatures lower than 112 kelvin, water ice should be stable to evaporation over time scales of billions of years.},

 abstract = {The importance of the discovery of jarosite at the Meridiani Planum region of Mars is discussed. Terrestrial studies demonstrate that jarosite requires a unique environment for its formation, crystallizing from highly acidic (pH $<$ 4) S-rich brines under highly oxidizing conditions. A likely scenario for jarosite formation on Mars is that degassing of shallow magmas likely released SO2 that reacted with aqueous solutions in shallow aquifers or on the martian surface. This interaction forms both H2SO4 and H2S. A martian oxidant must be identiﬁed to both oxidize H2S to produce the required acidity of the ﬂuid, and to oxidize Fe2+ to Fe3+. We suggest that reactions involving both sulfur and the reduction of CO2 to CO may provide part of the answer. The jarosite crystal structure is truly remarkable in terms of its tolerance for the substitution of a large number of diﬀerent cations with diﬀerent ionic radii and charges. The structure accommodates hydrogen, oxygen, and sulfur, the stable isotope systematics of which are strong recorders of low-temperature ﬂuid-rock-atmosphere interactions. Jarosite has been proven to be a robust chronometer for Ar–Ar and K–Ar dating techniques, and there is every reason to believe that U–Pb, Rb–Sr, and Nd–Sm techniques for older jarosite from Mars will also be robust. Although the discovery of jarosite on Mars alone, with no other analytical measurements on the phase, has given us insights to martian surﬁcial processes, the true power of jarosite can not be exploited until jarosite is sampled and returned from Mars. Mars sample return is a long way oﬀ but, until then, we should be vigilant about examining martian meteorites for alteration assemblages that contain jarosite. A suite of jarosite samples representing a signiﬁcant time span on Mars may hold the key to reading the record of martian atmospheric evolution.},

 abstract = {West Deuteronilus Mensae, which lies along the lowland/upland boundary of Mars at 45?? latitude, 345?? longitude, exhibits both gradational (L. A. Rossbacher, 1985,in Models in Geomorphology (Woldenberg, Ed), pp. 343-372, Allen \& Unwin, Boston) and fretted terrain (R.P. Sharp, 1973, J. Geophys. Res. 78, 4073-4083) boundary types. To the west, the boundary is gradational and to the east it is defined by fretted terrain. The two types of boundaries do not merge with one another within the west Deuteronilus Mensae region, however. The gradational boundary materials appear to overlap the fretted terrain by about 500 km. Contacts between units associated with the gradational boundary and the fretted terrain boundary can both be recognized in the region of overlap. The fretted terrain can be identified as much as 300 km north of the gradational boundary in this region. Lowland units associated with the gradational boundary embay canyons of the fretted terrain in a topographically conformal fashion. Changes in the fretted terrain across the gradational boundary (from uplands to lowlands) include a reduction of canyon wall slopes and depths, such that the fretted terrain north of the gradational boundary appears mantled but not obscured. There are at least two major classes of processes which might explain the lateral overlap: (1) erosion of stratified upland terrain and (2) deposition of plains materials onto the sloping upland margin and fretted terrain. Erosion of stratified upland terrain does not adequately explain the plainward decrease in crater densities across the gradational boundary nor is it consistent with evidence that lowland plains material appears to onlap the sloping upland margin in several places. Of the possible plains emplacement mechanisms, eolian deposition would not produce the sharp, apparently topographically conformal gradational unit contacts. Volcanics plains emplacement would not preserve the complex geometry of the underlying fretted terrain. Sediment deposition in either a liquid or ice-covered sea could produce the draped appearance of the fretted terrain. Outflow channels along the lowland/upland boundary, particularly those of the circum-Chryse and west Elysium regions, may have flooded the northern lowlands to depths of tens to hundreds of meters. The gradational unit contacts may represent the shorelines of such a sea. The scale of characteristic morphologies along these contacts may require an unfrozen condition of sufficient duration to allow lacustrine-style wave erosion and redistribution of material along the contacts. Our limited understanding of the Martian paleoclimate and H2O inventories allows the possibility of clement periods in the past, and other geological evidence (e.g., small valley networks and outflow channels) strongly suggests an extensive role of liquid water. ?? 1989.},

A comparison between seawater sulfate and marine carbonate carbon isotope records reveals no clear systematic coupling between the sulfur and carbon cycles over one to several millions of years, indicating that changes in the burial rate of pyrite sulfur and organic carbon did not singularly control the atmospheric oxygen content over short time intervals in the Cenozoic.

Two excursions toward isotopically lighter sulfur represent periods of lower rates of pyrite burial, implying a shift in the location of organic carbon burial to terrestrial or open-ocean settings.

 abstract = {In this study, a simple model was developed to estimate crop gross primary productivity (GPP) using a product of chlorophyll-related vegetation index, retrieved from MODIS 250. m data, and potential photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). Potential PAR is incident photosynthetically active radiation under a condition of minimal atmospheric aerosol loading. This model was proposed for GPP estimation based entirely on satellite data, and it was tested in maize and soybean, which are contrasting crop types different in leaf structures and canopy architectures, under different crop managements and climatic conditions. The model using MODIS 250. m data, which brings high temporal resolution and moderate spatial resolution, was capable of estimating GPP accurately in both irrigated and rainfed croplands in three Nebraska AmeriFlux sites during growing seasons 2001 through 2008. Among the MODIS-250. m retrieved indices tested, enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and wide dynamic range vegetation index (WDRVI) were the most accurate for GPP estimation with coefficients of variation below 20\% in maize and 25\% in soybean. It was shown that the developed model was able to accurately detect GPP variation in crops where total chlorophyll content is closely tied to seasonal dynamic of GPP. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

 abstract = {A suite of observations suggests that the northern plains of Mars, which cover nearly one third of the planet's surface, may once have contained an ocean. Perhaps the most provocative evidence for an ancient ocean is a set of surface features that ring the plains for thousands of kilometres and that have been interpreted as a series of palaeoshorelines of different age. It has been shown, however, that topographic profiles along the putative shorelines contain long-wavelength trends with amplitudes of up to several kilometres, and these trends have been taken as an argument against the martian shoreline (and ocean) hypothesis. Here we show that the long-wavelength topography of the shorelines is consistent with deformation caused by true polar wander--a change in the orientation of a planet with respect to its rotation pole--and that the inferred pole path has the geometry expected for a true polar wander event that postdates the formation of the massive Tharsis volcanic rise.},

The offset surface Finfd/inf of a given surface F is the set of points at fixed normal distance d of F. The conchoid surface Ginfd/inf of a given surface G is obtained by increasing the radius function by d with respect to a given reference point O. There is a nice relation between offsets and conchoids: The pedal surfaces of a family of offset surfaces are a family of conchoid surfaces. Since this relation is birational, a family of rational offset surfaces corresponds to a family of rational conchoid surfaces and vice versa. We present theoretical principles of this mapping and apply it to ruled surfaces and quadrics. Since these surfaces have rational offsets and conchoids, their pedal and inverse pedal surfaces are new classes of rational conchoid surfaces and rational offset surfaces.},

 abstract = {The transition between the Proterozoic and Phanerozoic eons, beginning 542 million years (Myr) ago, is distinguished by the diversification of multicellular animals and by their acquisition of mineralized skeletons during the Cambrian period. Considerable progress has been made in documenting and more precisely correlating biotic patterns in the Neoproterozoic-Cambrian fossil record with geochemical and physical environmental perturbations, but the mechanisms responsible for those perturbations remain uncertain. Here we use new stratigraphic and geochemical data to show that early Palaeozoic marine sediments deposited approximately 540-480 Myr ago record both an expansion in the area of shallow epicontinental seas and anomalous patterns of chemical sedimentation that are indicative of increased oceanic alkalinity and enhanced chemical weathering of continental crust. These geochemical conditions were caused by a protracted period of widespread continental denudation during the Neoproterozoic followed by extensive physical reworking of soil, regolith and basement rock during the first continental-scale marine transgression of the Phanerozoic. The resultant globally occurring stratigraphic surface, which in most regions separates continental crystalline basement rock from much younger Cambrian shallow marine sedimentary deposits, is known as the Great Unconformity. Although Darwin and others have interpreted this widespread hiatus in sedimentation on the continents as a failure of the geologic record, this palaeogeomorphic surface represents a unique physical environmental boundary condition that affected seawater chemistry during a time of profound expansion of shallow marine habitats. Thus, the formation of the Great Unconformity may have been an environmental trigger for the evolution of biomineralization and the 'Cambrian explosion' of ecologic and taxonomic diversity following the Neoproterozoic emergence of animals.},

 abstract = {Manifold changes in the freshwater cycle of high-latitude lands and oceans have been reported in the past few years. A synthesis of these changes in freshwater sources and in ocean freshwater storage illustrates the complementary and synoptic temporal pattern and magnitude of these changes over the past 50 years. Increasing river discharge anomalies and excess net precipitation on the ocean contributed approximately 20,000 cubic kilometers of fresh water to the Arctic and high-latitude North Atlantic oceans from lows in the 1960s to highs in the 1990s. Sea ice attrition provided another approximately 15,000 cubic kilometers, and glacial melt added approximately 2000 cubic kilometers. The sum of anomalous inputs from these freshwater sources matched the amount and rate at which fresh water accumulated in the North Atlantic during much of the period from 1965 through 1995. The changes in freshwater inputs and ocean storage occurred in conjunction with the amplifying North Atlantic Oscillation and rising air temperatures. Fresh water may now be accumulating in the Arctic Ocean and will likely be exported southward if and when the North Atlantic Oscillation enters into a new high phase.},

It distinguishes textures which are unambiguously igneous or metamorphic and divides metamorphic textures into four distinct types: porphyroclastic, cataclastic, foliated and equigranular mosaic. A separate category, allotriomorphic-granular, refers principally to coase-grained textures that are of unclear origin. In addition, textures that are dominated by partial melting are distinguished from igneous types. Interpretation of xenolith textures by reference to textures formed under experimental conditions is limited by lack of information about many of the factors which control xenolith textures. Until the effect of these factors is better understood, there can be no reliable completely genetic classification of xenolith textures.},

 abstract = {We calculate the cumulative width w of ductile shear zones accommodating plate motion in continental lithosphere, based on the assumptions that (1) the flow stress is controlled by the yield strength of intact rock at any given depth; (2) the yield strength profile through the crust can be constrained from observations in exhumed shear zones; and (3) strain localization is primarily caused by grainsize reduction leading to a switch to grainsize-sensitive creep. We use a mid-crustal stress-temperature profile measured in the Whipple Mountains, California, and calculate stress profiles at depth from published flow laws for feldspar and olivine. We conclude that w for a plate boundary shear zone accommodating 50 mm/yr displacement (comparable to the San Andreas Transform) may reach 180 km in the quartz-rich mid-crust, depending on water fugacity and thermal gradient. It narrows to a few meters in feldspathic lower crust and in the uppermost mantle, and then widens rapidly with depth in the lower lithosphere. We explore the effects of differences in crustal thickness and composition, thermal gradient, and water activity.},

 abstract = {Geotherm families in which surface heat flow is the principal independent variable have been constructed for continental and oceanic lithospheres. The continental model is characterized by geotherms in which surface heat flow is in equilibrium with heat flowing into the lithosphere at its base plus heat generated by radioactive decay within the lithosphere. The model accommodates the regional variation of the surface heat flow with proportional variations in the radioactivity of the surficial enriched zone and in the deeper heat flow. The proportionality is dictated by a new and general linear relationship between reduced heat flow and mean heat flow for a region (q* ??? 0.6 q ??0), which enables both q* and the mean heat production of the enriched zone to be estimated from knowledge of the mean surface heat flow of a province. The oceanic model is characterized by the transient cooling of a semi-infinite medium with an initial temperature gradient and some near-surface radiogenic heat production. The model yields a heat flow in satisfactory agreement with observations in the oldest ocean basins. The depth at which both the oceanic and continental geotherms reach ̃0.85 of the melting temperature is shown to be a consistent estimator of the depth to the top of the low-velocity channel, or the thickness of the high-velocity lid overlying the channel. We identify the lid as synonymous with the lithosphere, and produce a global map of lithospheric thickness based on the regional variation of surface heat flow. The lithosphere is less than 100 km thick over most of the globe, but thickens appreciably and becomes more viscous beneath the Precambrian shields and platforms, regions of low heat flow. These characteristics of shields are consistent with recently reported models of the driving mechanisms of the plate system, which require greater retarding forces beneath plates with large continental areas. ?? 1977.},

@article{Pollack1987,
 abstract = {Theoretical arguments are presented in support of the idea that Mars possessed a dense CO2 atmosphere and a wet, warm climate early in its history. Calculations with a one-dimensional radiative-convective climate model indicate that CO2 pressures between 1 and 5 bars would have been required to keep the surface temperature above the freezing point of water early in the planet's history. The higher value corresponds to globally and orbitally averaged conditions and a 30\% reduction in solar luminosity; the lower value corresponds to conditions at the equator during perihelion at times of high orbital eccentricity and the same reduced solar luminosity. The plausibility of such a CO2 greenhouse is tested by formulating a simple model of the CO2 geochemical cycle on early Mars. By appropriately scaling the rate of silicate weathering on present Earth, we estimate a weathering time constant of the order of several times 107 years for early Mars. Thus, a dense atmosphere could have persisted for a geologically significant time period (∼109years) only if atmospheric CO2 was being continuously resupplied. The most likely mechanism by which this might have been accomplished is the thermal decomposition of carbonate rocks induced directly and indirectly (through burial) by intense, global-scale volcanism. For plausible values of the early heat flux, the recycling time constant is also of the order of several times 107 years. The amount of CO2 dissolved in standing bodies of water was probably small; thus, the total surficial CO2 inventory required to maintain these conditions was approximately 2 to 10 bars. The amount of CO2 in Mars' atmosphere would eventually have dwindled, and the climate cooled, as the planet's internal heat engine ran down. A test for this theory will be provided by spectroscopic searches for carbonates in Mars' crust.},

 abstract = {ABSTRACT: Analyses of 3-D seismic data in predominantly basin-floor settings offshore Indonesia, Nigeria, and the Gulf of Mexico, reveal the extensive presence of gravity-flow depositional elements. Five key ele- ments were observed: (1) turbidity-flow leveed channels, (2) channel- overbank sediment waves and levees, (3) frontal splays or distributary- channel complexes, (4) crevasse-splay complexes, and (5) debris-flow channels, lobes, and sheets. Each depositional element displays a unique morphology and seismic expression. The reservoir architecture of each of these depositional elements is a function of the interaction between sedimentary process, sea-floor morphology, and sediment grain-size distribution. (1) Turbidity-flow leveed-channel widths range from greater than 3 km to less than 200 m. Sinuosity ranges from moderate to high, and channel meanders in most instances migrate down-system. The high- amplitude reflection character that commonly characterizes these fea- tures suggests the presence of sand within the channels. In some in- stances, high-sinuosity channels are associated with (2) channel-over- bank sediment-wave development in proximal overbank levee settings, especially in association with outer channel bends. These sediment waves reach heights of 20 m and spacings of 2–3 km. The crests of these sediment waves are oriented normal to the inferred transport direction of turbidity flows, and the waves have migrated in an up- flow direction. Channel-margin levee thickness decreases systematically down-system. Where levee thickness can no longer be resolved seis- mically, high-sinuosity channels feed (3) frontal splays or low-sinuosity, distributary-channel complexes. Low-sinuosity distributary-channel complexes are expressed as lobate sheets up to 5–10 km wide and tens of kilometers long that extend to the distal edges of these systems. They likely comprise sheet-like sandstone units consisting of shallow chan- nelized and associated sand-rich overbank deposits. Also observed are (4) crevasse-splay deposits, which form as a result of the breaching of levees, commonly at channel bends. Similar to frontal splays, but small- er in size, these deposits commonly are characterized by sheet-like tur- bidites. (5) Debris-flow deposits comprise low-sinuosity channel fills, narrow elongate lobes, and sheets and are characterized seismically by contorted, chaotic, low-amplitude reflection patterns. These deposits commonly overlie striated or grooved pavements that can be up to tens of kilometers long, 15 m deep, and 25 m wide. Where flows are un- confined, striation patterns suggest that divergent flow is common. De- bris-flow deposits extend as far basinward as turbidites, and individual debris-flow units can reach 80 m in thickness and commonly are marked by steep edges. Transparent to chaotic seismic reflection char- acter suggest that these deposits are mud-rich. Stratigraphically, deep-water basin-floor successions commonly are characterized by mass-transport deposits at the base, overlain by tur- bidite frontal-splay deposits and subsequently by leveed-channel de- posits. Capping this succession is another mass-transport unit ulti- mately overlain and draped by condensed-section deposits. This suc- cession can be related to a cycle of relative sea-level change and as- sociated events at the corresponding shelf edge. Commonly, deposition of a deep-water sequence is initiated with the onset of relative sea-level fall and ends with subsequent rapid relative sea-level rise.},

 abstract = {The recent identification of large deposits of sulphates by remote sensing and in situ observations has been considered evidence of the past presence of liquid water on Mars. Here we report the unambiguous detection of diverse phyllosilicates, a family of aqueous alteration products, on the basis of observations by the OMEGA imaging spectrometer on board the Mars Express spacecraft. These minerals are mainly associated with Noachian outcrops, which is consistent with an early active hydrological system, sustaining the long-term contact of igneous minerals with liquid water. We infer that the two main families of hydrated alteration products detected-phyllosilicates and sulphates--result from different formation processes. These occurred during two distinct climatic episodes: an early Noachian Mars, resulting in the formation of hydrated silicates, followed by a more acidic environment, in which sulphates formed.},

Sedimentological and stratigraphic analyses of the Otavi (mostly carbonate) and Mulden (siliciclastic molasse) Groups exposed along the southwestern margin of the Congo craton indicate that foreland-basin orogenesis began during middle Otavi (ca. 600 –750 Ma); this time frame is earlier than that for the Nama foreland (ca. 550 Ma) on the Kalahari craton. Evidence for this interpretation includes (1) an intra-Otavi angular unconformity; (2) concomitant development of increasing accommodation space, basin segmentation, and backstepping depositional systems composed mostly of deep-basin and slope hemipelagic and sediment gravity-ﬂow deposits; and (3) a near reversal in paleocurrents (initially northward off the Congo craton, then switching to southeastward from a west-northwestern orogen). Thus, Congo–Rio de la Plata suturing predated Congo-Kalahari suturing during the assembly of Gondwana.},

 abstract = {The Witvlei Group is preserved in two regional synclinoria in the Gobabis-Witvlei area of east-central Namibia and as isolated outcrops 90 km SW of Rehoboth, itself some 200 km south of that area. It consists of mixed, coarse- to fine-grained siliciclastic and carbonate strata deposited in deep- to shallow-marine, and locally non-marine, settings along the post-rift continental margin of the Kalahari Craton prior to the onset of foreland basin sedimentation recorded by the overlying terminal Neoproterozoic–Cambrian Nama Group. No direct age constrains exist for the Witvlei Group, but it post-dates c. 800 Ma rift-related rocks and pre-dates the c. 548 Ma base of the Nama Group, thereby placing it as Cryogenian to Ediacaran in age. The Witvlei Group consists of three main units, from oldest to youngest, the Blaubeker, Court and Buschmannsklippe Formations. The Blaubeker Formation is highly variable in thickness and can be as much as 1000 m thick. It consists mostly of massive, polymict diamictite and, in the area of the type locality, contains conglomerate and pebbly sandstone beds. The diamictic strata combined with the presence of numerous faceted and striated clasts provide the evidence for glaciogenic influences on sedimentation. The highly variable thickness pattern likely reflects the infill of palaeo-valleys formed by the deep erosion and scouring of bedrock by ice, and the conglomerates and pebbly sandstones record glacial outwash processes. The Tahiti Formation is a locally developed, fine-grained sandstone above the Blaubeker Formation. It is poorly exposed and its exact stratigraphic relationship to the Blaubeker rocks and overlying Court Formation remains to be determined. The Blaubeker rocks are overlain sharply by the basal unit of the Court Formation, the Gobabis Member. This Member is from 20 to 60 m thick and consists mostly of dark and light grey laminated dolostones that display a δ13Ccarbonate profile that rises from values of −4‰ in the lowermost beds to values of 5‰ in the topmost. The Gobabis Member is conformably overlain by the shales, marls and thin limestones of the Constance Member followed by quartzites of the uppermost unit of the Court Formation, the Simmenau Member. The basal unit of the Buschmannsklippe Formation is the light to tan and pink grey dolostone of the Bildah Member. Its basal contact is sharp everywhere, and it is gradationally overlain by a coarsening (shoaling) upward succession from shales, thin limestones (some exhibiting formerly aragonitic fans) and fine sandstones of the La Fraque Member, to interbedded quartzites and stromatolitic and cherty dolostones of the Okambara Member. The δ13Ccarbonate profile for the Buschmannsklippe rocks shows that the basal beds of the Bildah Member begin at –4‰, followed by a decline to –6‰ in the lower La Fraque limestones and then a rise to –3‰ in the dolostones of the Okambara Member before being truncated by the base of the regionally unconformably overlying basal Weissberg Quartzite Member of the lower Nama Group. Although no glacial sediments have been recognized below the Bildah Member, its lithofacies character, stratigraphic position and C-isotopic profile are compatible with and strikingly similar to younger Cryogenian cap carbonates. Thus, the Witvlei Grooth the older and younger cap carbonatese, but only the older Cryogenian glacial deposit.darybA2-Disposition: form-data},

 abstract = {Microbial structures in Neoproterozoic cap carbonates record the environmental processes present in the aftermath of global glaciation. The Rasthof Formation of northern Namibia is a unique carbonate depositional sequence that formed during post-glacial transgression and highstand following the Chuos glaciation. Carbon isotope profiles from four examined localities reveal that onlap was diachronous over post-glacial, syn-rift topography. The lower Rasthof Formation consists primarily of dark gray thinly ($<$mm) and thickly (1–4mm) laminated microbialites that exhibit different rheological responses to the emplacement of syndepositional dikes. The thinly laminated microbialaminite facies commonly host cm-sized syndepositional folds of microbially laminated sediment called roll-up structures. In more thickly laminated facies, layers are deformed into broad decimeter-sized folds, but roll-up structures are absent. Large syndepositional carbonate clastic dikes (0.5–1m wide) and smaller veins (0.1–0.5m) cut across bedding in both the thinly and thickly laminated facies, but are conspicuously absent from underlying and overlying beds. These carbonate clastic dikes and veins contain convoluted microbial mats and abundant marine cements. The lack of evidence for wave action or current scouring in the form of bedforms, scour marks, or intraclasts indicates that these microbialaminites formed below storm wave base. The close spatial association of deep-water microbialaminite facies in the Rasthof cap carbonate with carbonate clastic dikes suggests that the emplacement of dikes produced both dm-sized broad folds and cm-scale laterally discontinuous roll-up structures. The emplacement of the dikes, most likely due to the release of fluids into incompletely lithified mats, deformed cement-rich thick laminites into broad folds, while thinly laminated and more slowly lithifying mats were rolled into roll-up structures. Microbialaminite facies in the Rasthof cap carbonate thus not only reflect the depositional and environmental processes that operated in the aftermath of the Sturtian glaciation, but may also provide clues for the formation of roll-up structures found in even older Precambrian carbonates.},

 abstract = {The structure and composition of inner geospheres are considered in light of new data on the structural transformations of minerals under high pressure. More than 100 tetrahedral complexes in silicates of the Earth's crust give way to no more than 20 structural types of minerals of this class in the Earth's mantle. The main difference in their structures is associated with the transformation of Si tetrahedra into Si octahedra. New data on the structural transformations of minerals in deep geospheres indicate that the mineralogical diversity of the Earth's crust is substantially richer than that of deep geospheres; however, mantle mineralogy is not as primitive as was supposed even twenty or thirty years ago. The results of recent seismological investigations and quantum-mechanical calculations allow the assumption that there exists a new previously unknown phase transformation under the conditions in the Earth's inner core. According to seismic tomography maps for various depth levels and available data on geophysical discontinuities, mineral composition, and phase transformations in the mantle, it is proposed that the latter can be subdivided into six geospheres. The cornerstone of the new concept lies in the recognition of middle mantle between 840 and 1700. km, which is separated from the upper and lower mantle by boundary zones, 170 and 500. km thick, respectively. The first approach to the origin and geological history of deep-seated geospheres is discussed. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V..},

 abstract = {Valley networks on Mars are the most obvious features attesting that different geologic processes and possibly climatic conditions existed in the past. THEMIS images reveal valley networks within Melas Chasma, in Valles Marineris, a Hesperian-age canyon system. The valley networks in Melas Chasma are dense and highly organized, and the heads of the valleys are scattered at different elevations. All these features suggest that the networks were fed by precipitation. The morphological details reveal inner channels on some valley floors, attesting that water flowed within these valleys. On the DEM, the valleys flow into a completely enclosed depression. The edge of this feature follows a MOLA contour line, and the depression shows many sedimentary morphologies suggesting lacustrine environment. These landforms are located on remnants of layered deposits possibly composed of sulfate layers suggesting that fluvial activity could have contributed to the erosion of the layered terrains in Valles Marineris. Collectively, the features in Melas Chasma are a maximum of Hesperian in age. These results suggest that warm, wet environmental conditions on Mars persisted through the Hesperian and were present during the formation of Valles Marineris. The evidence for a paleolake in Melas Chasma attests to adequate environmental conditions for life development through the Hesperian period.},

The Sm/Nd formation interval of the lunar mantle from these data is 215(-21)(+23) million years after the onset of solar system condensation. Because both Earth and the Moon likely formed in the same region of the solar nebula, Earth should also have a chondritic bulk composition. In order to mass balance the Nd budget, these constraints require that a complementary reservoir with a lower 142Nd/144Nd value resides in Earth's mantle.},

 abstract = {Abstract Forest fires in large sparsely populated areas in the boreal forest zone are difficult to detect by ground based means. Satellites can be a viable source of information to augment air-borne reconnaissance. The Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) sensor aboard the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) satellites has been used to detect and map fires in the past mainly in the tropics and mainly for environmental monitoring purposes. This article describes real-time forest fire detection where the aim is to inform local fire authorities on the fire. The fire detection is based on the 3.7 mu m channel of the NOAA AVHRR sensor. In the fire detection algorithm, imaging geometry is taken into account in addition to the data from the near-infrared and thermal infrared channels. In an experiment in summer 1995, 16 fires were detected in Finland. One was a forest fire, 11 were prescribed burnings and 4 false alarms. Three of the false alarms were due to steel factories.

Rotary or fixed wing UAVs, capable of performing the photogrammetric data acquisition with amateur or SLR digital cameras, can fly in manual, semi-automated and autonomous modes. With a typical photogrammetric pipeline, 3D results like DSM/DTM, contour lines, textured 3D models, vector data, etc. can be produced, in a reasonable automated way. The paper reports the latest developments of UAV image processing methods for photogrammetric applications, mapping and 3D modeling issues. Automation is nowadays necessary and feasible at the image orientation, DSM generation and orthophoto production stages, while accurate feature extraction is still an interactive procedure.

@article{Renaut2013,
 abstract = {Travertine is present at 20\% of the ca 60 hot springs that discharge on Loburu delta plain on the western margin of saline, alkaline Lake Bogoria in the Kenya Rift. Much of the travertine, which forms mounds, low terraces and pool-rim dams, is sub-fossil (relict) and undergoing erosion, but calcite-encrusted artefacts show that carbonate is actively precipitating at several springs. Most of the springs discharge alkaline (pH: 8˙3 to 8˙9), Na-HCO3 waters containing little Ca (2~mg~l−1) at temperatures of 94 to 97˙5°C. These travertines are unusual because most probably precipitated at temperatures of 80°C. The travertines are composed mainly of dendritic and platy calcite, with minor Mg-silicates, aragonite, fluorite and opaline silica. Calcite precipitation is attributed mainly to rapid CO2 degassing, which led to high-disequilibrium crystal morphologies. Stratigraphic evidence shows that the travertine formed during several stages separated by intervals of non-deposition. Radiometric ages imply that the main phase of travertine formation occurred during the late Pleistocene (ca 32 to 35~ka). Periods of precipitation were influenced strongly by fluctuations in lake level, mostly under climate control, and by related changes in the depth of boiling. During relatively arid phases, meteoric recharge of ground water declines, the lake is low and becomes hypersaline, and the reduced hydrostatic pressure lowers the level of boiling in the plumbing system of the hot springs. Any carbonate precipitation then occurs below the land surface. During humid phases, the dilute meteoric recharge increases, enhancing geothermal circulation, but the rising lake waters, which become relatively dilute, flood most spring vents. Much of the aqueous Ca2+ then precipitates as lacustrine stromatolites on shallow firm substrates, including submerged older travertines. Optimal conditions for subaerial travertine precipitation at Loburu occur when the lake is at intermediate levels, and may be favoured during transitions from humid to drier conditions.},

The present work considers statistical errors in the fitted parameters, as well as in the values of the fitted function itself, resulting from random errors in the data. Expressions are derived for the standard error of the fit, as a function of the inde- pendent variable, for the general nonlinear and linear fitting problems. Additionally, closed-form expressions are derived for some examples commonly encountered in the scientific and engineering fields, namely, ordinary polynomial and Gaussian fitting functions. These results have direct application to the assessment of antenna gain and system temperature characteristics, in addition to a broad range of problems in data analysis. The effects of the nature of the data and the choice of fitting func- tion on the ability to accurately model the system under study are discussed, and some general rules are deduced to assist workers intent on maximizing the amount of information obtained from a given set of measurements.},

 abstract = {We characterize the lithospheric structure of Isidis Planitia on Mars by analyzing Mars Global Surveyor and Mars Odyssey gravity and topography data using a flexural model of a thin elastic shell including bending and membrane stresses. Isidis Planitia is a circular, relatively flat plain formed near the end of the Early Noachian, at the edge of the highlands-lowlands boundary and the site of a large free-air gravity anomaly, features consistent with modification and filling of an impact basin. Our results suggest that the bulk density of the fill material inside Isidis must be more than 2600 kg m-3 and higher densities are probable. A comparison of the faulting observed at Nili Fossae to the predicted zone of extensional strain northwest of Isidis constrains the thickness of the elastic lithosphere to be 100-180 km thick beneath the basin at the time of loading. We also find that loads outside of the basin play a significant role in the interpretation of the tectonics; simplified models tend to overestimate the lithospheric thickness. We place relatively narrow bounds on the thermal gradient (3.4-6.5 K km-1) and heat flux (13.6-26 mW m-2) at Isidis at the time of loading. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

 abstract = {The East Candor Interior Layered Deposit (ILD) has signatures of mono- and polyhydrated sulfate in alternating layers that give insight into the processes which formed these layered deposits and on the environmental conditions acting on them since then. We use orbital data to explore multiple hypotheses for how these deposits formed: (1) sulfate-bearing ILDs experience hydration changes on seasonal to a few years timescales under current Mars environmental conditions; (2) the deposits experience hydration under recent Mars conditions but require the wetter climate of high obliquity; and (3) the kieserite could be an original or diagenetic part of a complex evaporite mineral assemblage. Modeled climatology shows recent Mars environmental conditions might pass between multiple sulfate fields. However, comparison of Observatoire pour la Minéralogie, l'Eau, les Glaces et l'Activité (OMEGA) and Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer (CRISM) observations of the same ILD do not show changes in hydration over 2 Mars years. Low temperatures might slow the kinetics of that transition; it is likely that more clement conditions during periods of high obliquity are needed to overcome mineral metastability and hydrate kieserite-bearing deposits. We find the alternate model, that the deposit is a cyclic evaporite sequence of mono- and polyhydrated sulfates, also plausible but with an unexplained dearth of Fe sulfates.},

Garnet is unstable in MORB-Pyrolite below 2.8 GPa (depths 85 km) at a solidus temperature of 1470°C. In Tinaquillo Lherzolite, which is related to MORB-Pyrolite by about 7\% fractional melting, the transformation occurs at 3.1 GPa at a solidus temperature of 1520°C. In both cases the transformation interval is narrow, approximately 0.1-0.2 GPa. Because the solidus temperature increases by 7°C and the spinel-garnet transformation pressure by 0.05 GPa for every 1\% melt extracted, extremely high potential temperatures (T(p)  1450°C) are required to generate the 3-5\% melting in the garnet field implied by recent trace element and isotope studies. It appears likely, therefore, that the 'garnet signature' arises from some mechanism other than anhydrous melting of garnet peridotite.},

 abstract = {The Anza section of the San Jacinto fault, southern California, has not experienced a groundbreaking earthquake since at least 1918 and probably since before 1899, leading previous workers to designate this 20-km-long fault segment as a seismic gap. Study of displaced Pleistocene and Holocene alluvial fan and fluvial deposits across the San Jacinto fault near Anza, California, dated using 14C and soil development age control, indicates a minimum right-lateral slip rate of 9.2 ± 2 mm/yr since 9.5 ka, and a slip rate of 11+9 −5 mm/yr since 14 ka, 12+9 −5 mm/yr since 17 ka, and 13+10 −6 mm/yr since 50 ka. These estimates agree with a previously determined 700 ka to present minimum slip rate of 10 ± 2 mm/yr. Based on an estimated average slip rate of 12 mm/yr from the longer-term slip rate estimates, about 0.8 m of potential slip has accumulated if the 1918 earthquake broke the Anza segment; over 1.1 m of potential slip has accumulated if the last earthquake occurred prior to 1899. These data attest to the potential for an earthquake ≥ M6.5 for this section of the fault.},

 abstract = {The oxygen fugacity f(O2)of the Earth's mantle is one of the fundamental variables in mantle petrology. Through ferric-ferrous iron and carbon-hydrogen-oxygen equilibria, f(O2) influences the pressure-temperature positions of mantle solidi and compositions of small-degree mantle melts. Among other parameters, f(O2) affects the water storage capacity and rheology of the mantle. The uppermost mantle, as represented by samples and partial melts, is sufficiently oxidized to sustain volatiles, such as H2O and CO2, as well as carbonatitic melts, but it is not known whether the shallow mantle is representative of the entire upper mantle. Using high-pressure experiments, we show here that large parts of the asthenosphere are likely to be metal-saturated. We found that pyroxene and garnet synthesized at 7 GPa in equilibrium with metallic Fe can incorporate sufficient ferric iron that the mantle at 250 km depth is so reduced that an (Fe,Ni)-metal phase may be stable. Our results indicate that the oxidized nature of the upper mantle can no longer be regarded as being representative for the Earth's upper mantle as a whole and instead that oxidation is a shallow phenomenon restricted to an upper veneer only about 250 km in thickness.},

 abstract = {Eight spinel-group minerals were synthesized by a flux-growth method producing spinels with varying composition and Fesup3+/sup/Feinftot/inf ratios. The mean force constants of iron bonds in these minerals were determined by synchrotron nuclear resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (NRIXS) in order to determine the reduced isotopic partition function ratios (β-factors) of these spinels. The mean force constants are strongly dependent on the Fesup3+/sup/Feinftot/inf of the spinel but are independent, or weakly dependent on other structural and compositional parameters. From our spectroscopic data, it is found that a single redox-dependent calibration line accounts for the effects of Fesup3+/sup/Feinftot/inf on the β-factors of spinels. This calibration successfully describes the equilibrium Fe isotopes fractionation factors between spinels and silicates (olivine and pyroxenes). Our predictions are in excellent agreement with independent determinations for the equilibrium Fe isotopic fractionations for the magnetite-fayalite and the magnetite-hedenbergite couples. Our calibration applies to the entire range of Fesup3+/sup/Feinftot/inf ratios found in natural spinels and provides a basis for interpreting iron isotopic variations documented in mantle peridotites. Except for a few exceptions, most of the samples measured so far are in isotopic disequilibrium, reflecting metasomatism and partial melting processes.},

 abstract = {Unequivocal geological signatures of seismic slip are rare, exceptionally so in carbonate-hosted faults where carbonate minerals dissociate at temperatures lower than those required for producing a friction melt. This thermal dissociation leads to significant fault weakening by increased fluid pressure and/or nanoparticle lubrication, preventing further heating of the fault surface. Pseudotachylyte is therefore unlikely to form in carbonate-hosted faults, and other evidence for seismic slip must be identified. We studied the lower Cambrian Naukluft Thrust which crops out in central Namibia. It contains a cataclastic dolomite fault rock, referred to as "gritty dolomite", which we interpret as a signature of coseismic carbonate dissociation and subsequent fluid-rock interactions. The fault was active at ambient temperatures below 200°C."Gritty dolomite" contains: rounded, low aspect ratio dolomite clasts with a uniform Fe-rich dolomite coating, euhedral to subhedral magnetite, quartz, and K-feldspar in a fine-grained, massive to laminated carbonate matrix of particulate dolomite and crystalline calcite cement. The fault rock texture, combined with evidence of injectites of gritty dolomite into the wallrock, indicates the cataclasite deformed as a fluidized granular flow. At seismic slip velocities, frictional heating caused dissociation of dolomite to CO 2 and Ca-, Fe- and Mg-oxides. This release of CO 2 decreased the pH of the pore fluid in the fault, causing dissolution and rounding of dolomite clasts within an inertial grain flow, and precipitation of carbonate coatings and euhedral silicates and oxides during subsequent cooling and CO 2 escape. Examples of similar rocks having some, if not all of these characteristics have been described from other carbonate-hosted faults. The geological setting of the Naukluft Thrust is unique in spatial extent and quality of exposure, allowing us to eliminate alternative hypotheses for sources of CO 2 to drive fluidization. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

 abstract = {Seismic, gravity and magnetotelluric data are used to model the two-dimensional heat transfer beneath an E-W vertical cross section ranging from the Black Forest, Rhinegraben to the southern Vosges. The temperature field at the present time has been calculated taking into account the effect of temperature on thermal conductivity and the radiogenic heat sources. Heat flow density conditions at depth, computed by solving iteratively the heat equation and comparing the heat flow measured at the surface with the calculated one, have been used. As the resulting heat flow condition at depth is very sensitive to the interpolation method used to estimate the heat flow values at the surface, a confidence interval of the thermal field is then proposed by varying the possible mantle heat flow conditions using a Monte Carlo method. Arguments based on petrological considerations suggest that a temperature condition could be used at the Moho. The resulting model involves regional surface heat flow densities ranging from a normal crustal value of 70 mW m-2 to a highest value of 105 mW m-2, in agreement with actual measurements. The results are compatible with those obtained by the German KTB Program on the Black Forest (Gehlen et al., 1986) and on the Swiss traverse (Rybach, 1979). They suggest that the regional high heat flow (105 mW m-2) measured in the southern Vosges is caused by the high radiogenic elements content (especially thorium) of the Cr??tes sub-alkaline granite and by an asymmetry in the lithospheric heating. High heat flow density values observed along the Rhinegraben give evidence of heat refraction phenomena around high conductivity rocks. ?? 1988.},

 abstract = {We investigate the putative Pliocene–Quaternary removal of mantle lithosphere from beneath the southern Sierra Nevada region using a synthesis of subsidence data from the Great Valley, and geomorphic relations across the Sierra Nevada. These findings are used to test the results and predictions of thermomechanical modeling of the lithosphere removal process that is specific to the Sierra Nevada, as presented in an accompanying paper referenced here as Part I. Our most successful thermomechanical model and the observational data that it explains are further bundled into an integrated physiographic evolution–geodynamic model for the three-dimensional epeirogenic deformation field that has affected mainly the southern Sierra Nevada–San Joaquin Basin region as a result of underlying mantle lithosphere removal.$\backslash$nThe coupled Sierra Nevada mountain range and Great Valley basin are recognized as a relatively rigid block (Sierra Nevada microplate) moving within the San Andreas–Walker Lane dextral plate juncture system. Our analysis recognizes that the Sierra Nevada possessed kilometer-scale local and regional paleotopographic relief, and that the Great Valley forearc basin possessed comparable structural relief on its principal stratigraphic horizons, both dating back to the end of Cretaceous time. Such ancient paleorelief must be accounted for in considering late Cenozoic components of uplift and subsidence across the microplate. We further recognize that Cenozoic rock and surface uplift must be considered from the perspectives of both local epeirogeny driven by mantle lithosphere removal, and regional far-field–forced epeirogeny driven by plate tectonics and regional upper-mantle buoyancy structure. Stratigraphic relations of Upper Cretaceous and lower Cenozoic marine strata lying on northern and southern Sierra Nevada basement provide evidence for near kilometer-scale rock uplift in the Cenozoic. Such uplift is likely to have possessed positive, and then superposed negative (subsidence) stages of relief generation, rendering net regional rock and surface uplift. Accounting for ancient paleorelief and far-field–driven regional uplift leaves a residual pattern whereby ∼1200 m of southeastern Sierra crest rock and similar surface uplift, and ∼700 m of spatially and temporally linked tectonic subsidence in the southern Great Valley were required in the late Cenozoic by mantle lithosphere removal. These values are close to the predictions of our modeling, but application of the model results to the observed geology is complicated by spatial and temporal variations in the regional tectonics that probably instigated mantle lithosphere removal, as well as spatial and temporal variations in the observed uplift and subsidence patterns. Considerable focus is given to these spatial-temporal variation patterns, which are interpreted to reflect a complex three-dimensional pattern resulting from the progressive removal of mantle lithosphere from beneath the region, as well as its epeirogenic expressions. The most significant factor is strong evidence that mantle lithosphere removal was first driven by an east-to-west pattern of delamination in late Miocene–Pliocene time, and then rapidly transitioned to a south-to-north pattern of delamination in the Quaternary.},

 abstract = {We present an estimate for the composition of the depleted mantle (DM), the source for mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORBs). A combination of approaches is required to estimate the major and trace element abundances in DM. Absolute concentrations of few elements can be estimated directly, and the bulk of the estimates is derived using elemental ratios. The isotopic composition of MORB allows calculation of parent-daughter ratios. These estimates form the "backbone'' of the abundances of the trace elements that make up the Coryell-Masuda diagram ( spider diagram). The remaining elements of the Coryell-Masuda diagram are estimated through the composition of MORB. A third group of estimates is derived from the elemental and isotopic composition of peridotites. The major element composition is obtained by subtraction of a low-degree melt from a bulk silicate Earth (BSE) composition. The continental crust (CC) is thought to be complementary to the DM, and ratios that are chondritic in the CC are expected to also be chondritic in the DM. Thus some of the remaining elements are estimated using the composition of CC and chondrites. Volatile element and noble gas concentrations are estimated using constraints from the composition of MORBs and ocean island basalts (OIBs). Mass balance with BSE, CC, and DM indicates that CC and this estimate of the DM are not complementary reservoirs.},

 abstract = {The sensitivity of Amazon rainforests to dry-season droughts is still poorly understood, with reports of enhanced tree mortality and forest fires on one hand, and excessive forest greening on the other. Here, we report that the previous results of large-scale greening of the Amazon, obtained from an earlier version of satellite-derived vegetation greenness data - Collection 4 (C4) Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), are irreproducible, with both this earlier version as well as the improved, current version (C5), owing to inclusion of atmosphere-corrupted data in those results. We find no evidence of large-scale greening of intact Amazon forests during the 2005 drought - approximately 11\%–12\% of these drought-stricken forests display greening, while, 28\%–29\% show browning or no-change, and for the rest, the data are not of sufficient quality to characterize any changes. These changes are also not unique - approximately similar changes are observed in non-drought years as well. Changes in surface solar irradiance are contrary to the speculation in the previously published report of enhanced sunlight availability during the 2005 drought. There was no co-relation between drought severity and greenness changes, which is contrary to the idea of drought-induced greening. Thus, we conclude that Amazon forests did not green-up during the 2005 drought.},

 abstract = {The East African Rift (EAR) is a type locale for investigating the processes that drive continental rifting and breakup. The current kinematics of this \textasciitilde{}5000 km long divergent plate boundary between the Nubia and Somalia plates is starting to be unraveled thanks to a recent augmentation of space geodetic data in Africa. Here we use a new data set combining episodic GPS measurements with continuous measurements on the Nubian, Somalian, and Antarctic plates, together with earthquake slip vector directions and geologic indicators along the Southwest Indian Ridge to update the present?day kinematics of the EAR. We use geological and seismological data to determine the main rift faults and solve for rigid block rotations while accounting for elastic strain accumulation on locked active faults. We find that the data are best fit with a model that includes three microplates embedded within the EAR, between Nubia and Somalia (Victoria, Rovuma, and Lwandle), consistent with previous findings but with slower extension rates. We find that earthquake slip vectors provide information that is consistent with the GPS velocities and helps to significantly reduce uncertainties of plate angular velocity estimates. We also find that 3.16?Myr MORVEL average spreading rates along the Southwest Indian Ridge are systematically faster than prediction from GPS data alone. This likely indicates that outward displacement along the SWIR is larger than the default value used in the MORVEL plate motion model.},

Ediacaran-type body fossils and the stratigraphic carbon-isotope variability indicate a Vendian age for much of these strata; the Precambrian-Cambrian boundary is in the uppermost part of the Schwarzrand Subgroup. Radiometric dating of abundant volcanic ash beds which span much of the Vendian and extend into the Cambrian part of the section could make the Nama Group the best calibrated reference section for Vendian chronostratigraphy. Here we describe the sedimentology and sequence stratigraphy of exposures of the Kuibis and Schwarzrand Subgroups in southwestern Namibia. We place tighter environmental constraints on the paleontology and geochemistry and we identify seven depositional sequences. The boundaries of the depositional sequences correspond to the more important disconformities in the Kuibis and Schwarzrand Subgroups; their identification is crucial for defining rates of organism evolution and isotopic differentiation. ?? 1995 Elsevier Science B.V.

 abstract = {Integrated sequence stratigraphic and chemostratigraphic data yield a framework for correlations of stratigraphic units in the terminal Proterozoic to Cambrian Witvlei and Nama Groups of Namibia. Coupled with precise U-Pb zircon age constraints, these correlations make it possible to construct a composite reference section for use in calibrating terminal Proterozoic chronostratigraphy. The Namibian reference section starts with two distinct glacial horizons and extends up to within 1 million years of the Proterozoic-Cambrian boundary. The two glacial horizons may represent each of two distinct Varanger-age glaciations better known from the North Atlantic region. From the higher of the two glacial horizons up, the composite stratigraphy preserves one of the thickest and most complete available records of carbon-isotope variability in post-Varanger terminal Proterozoic seawater. Four carbon-isotope chemostratigraphic intervals are recognized: (1) a postglacial negative delta 13C excursion (Npg interval); (2) a rising interval (Pr interval) of increasing positive delta 13C values; (3) a falling interval (Pf interval) characterized by decreasing positive delta 13C and culminating in near zero or negative values; and (4) an interval of moderately positive, relatively invariant delta 13C values (I interval) that extends up to the unconformity that contains the Proterozoic-Cambrian boundary. Each of these chemostratigraphic intervals can be recognized in widely separated correlative sections around the world. By comparing sediment accumulation rate in the radiometrically calibrated Namibian stratigraphy with sediment accumulation rates in correlative sections in Arctic Canada and Oman, a maximum age of 564 Ma is estimated for the end of the younger Varanger glaciation, 25 m.y. younger than previous estimates.},

 abstract = {Subduction of oceanic lithosphere occurs through two modes: subducting plate motion and trench migration. Using a global subduction zone data set and three-dimensional numerical subduction models, we show that slab width (W) controls these modes and the partitioning of subduction between them. Subducting plate velocity scales with W(2/3), whereas trench velocity scales with 1/W. These findings explain the Cenozoic slowdown of the Farallon plate and the decrease in subduction partitioning by its decreasing slab width. The change from Sevier-Laramide orogenesis to Basin and Range extension in North America is also explained by slab width; shortening occurred during wide-slab subduction and overriding-plate-driven trench retreat, whereas extension occurred during intermediate to narrow-slab subduction and slab-driven trench retreat.},

 abstract = {New high-resolution P- and S-wave tomography of the United States upper mantle from the Pacific Coast to the Great Plains reveals strong multi-scale heterogeneity closely correlated with tectonic and magmatic activity. We invert teleseismic travel-time residuals from the EarthScope Transportable Array and more than 1700 additional temporary and permanent stations for 3-D velocity perturbations to a depth of 1000km. The inversion uses recent advances in western U.S. crust models to better isolate the mantle component of travel-time residuals, and frequency-dependent 3-D sensitivity kernels to map travel-time residuals, measured in multiple frequency bands, into velocity structure. In addition to separate VP and VS models, we jointly invert the two datasets for VP/VS perturbations by imposing a smoothness constraint on the ??lnVS/??lnVP field. The joint inversion helps us identify regions where partial melt is probable. The amplitude of VP, VS, and VP/VS variations is greatest in the upper 200km of the mantle and the form of velocity anomalies suggests a provincially heterogeneous lithosphere and the occurrence of widespread small-scale convection. Partially molten mantle is inferred beneath Yellowstone and the eastern Snake River Plain (SRP), the Salton Trough, and the Clear Lake volcanic field. The inferred depth extent of partial melt is consistent with a generally hydrated upper mantle and elevated temperatures beneath the eastern SRP and Yellowstone. Despite continuous subduction since the Cretaceous, the distribution of sub-lithospheric high-velocity anomalies is dissected (similar to other recent studies). Based on our new tomography models, western U.S. geologic history, and plate-tectonic reconstructions, we infer patchy and incomplete removal of the flat-subducting Laramide slab and slab tearing associated with Eocene accretion in the northwestern U.S. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

 abstract = {Teleseismic tomography images a large high-velocity "curtain" extending vertically beneath the ca. 50 Ma Challis magmatic trend to maximum depths of 230-600 km. We interpret this structure as subducted Farallon ocean lithosphere that stalled with the ca. 55 Ma accretion of the Siletzia microplate to North America within the Columbia Embayment, and we consider the regional tectonic implications. The abrupt switch ca. 53 Ma from Laramide thrusting and magmatic quiescence to extension and vigorous magmatism in the northwestern United States is evidence for foundering of the flat-subducting Farallon slab. To account for the imaged curtain, foundering apparently occurred by rollback after Siletzia accretion terminated subduction within the Columbia Embayment. The magnitude of the high seismic velocity curtain is approximately that expected for 20-50 m.y. old ocean lithosphere that stalled in the upper mantle ca. 50 Ma. We suggest that the stalled slab became nearly neutrally buoyant as a result of removal of its basaltic crust, the melting of which likely contributed to the short-lived vigor of Challis magmatism. After Siletzia accretion, normal dip Cascadia subduction initiated west of Siletzia, evidenced by arc volcanism in Oregon and Washington beginning ca. 45-40 Ma, while continued quiescence of the Sierra Nevada arc suggests persistence of flat subduction to the south. Kinematically, this requires a tear in the subducted Farallon slab near the latitude of southern Oregon. We propose that north to south propagation of this torn slab edge propagated the ignimbrite flare-up across what now is the northern Basin and Range and ended the Laramide orogeny.},

Major features of the final P and S models include two distinct low-velocity anomalies at depths of ̃60–300 km beneath the central and northern Appalachians and passive margin. The central Appalachian low-velocity anomaly coincides with Eocene basaltic magmatism, and the northern anomaly is located along the Cretaceous track of the Great Meteor hot spot.

 abstract = {Variations in the strength of the North Atlantic Ocean thermohaline circulation have been linked to rapid climate changes during the last glacial cycle through oscillations in North Atlantic Deep Water formation and northward oceanic heat flux. The strength of the thermohaline circulation depends on the supply of warm, salty water to the North Atlantic, which, after losing heat to the atmosphere, produces the dense water masses that sink to great depths and circulate back south. Here we analyse two Caribbean Sea sediment cores, combining Mg/Ca palaeothermometry with measurements of oxygen isotopes in foraminiferal calcite in order to reconstruct tropical Atlantic surface salinity during the last glacial cycle. We find that Caribbean salinity oscillated between saltier conditions during the cold oxygen isotope stages 2, 4 and 6, and lower salinities during the warm stages 3 and 5, covarying with the strength of North Atlantic Deep Water formation. At the initiation of the Bølling/Allerød warm interval, Caribbean surface salinity decreased abruptly, suggesting that the advection of salty tropical waters into the North Atlantic amplified thermohaline circulation and contributed to high-latitude warming.},

 abstract = {Understanding the effect of variation in climate on large-fire occurrence across broad geographic areas is central to effective fire hazard assessment. The El Nin˜o– Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) affect winter temperature and precipitation regimes in western North America through mid-latitude teleconnections. This study examines relationships of ENSO and the PDO to drought-induced fire occurrence in subalpine forests of three study areas across the Rocky Mountains: Jasper National Park (JNP, northern Rockies), Yellowstone National Park (YNP, central Rockies) and Rocky Mountain National Park (RMNP, southern Rockies) over the 1700–1975 period. Large-scale climatic anomalies captured by ENSO (NIN˜ O3) and PDO indices had differential effects on large-fire occurrence across the study areas. Superposed epoch analysis (SEA) showed that large fires in RMNP occurred during extreme La Nin˜a years, while the PDO, although predominantly negative during fire years, did not depart significantly from the mean. In YNP and JNP, neither ENSO nor PDO indices were significantly different from the mean during large-fire years, although fires tended to occur during El Nin˜o and positive PDO years. Constructive phases (years of combined warm [positive] or cool [negative] phases) of ENSO and the PDO were significantly associated with large-fire occurrence across the Rockies, even though these large-scale climatic anomalies were not significant when considered singly in SEAs. Combined warm phases (positive PDO during El Nin˜o) co-occurred with large fires in the central and northern Rockies, while the combined cool phases (negative PDO during La Nin˜a) appeared to promote large fires in the southern Rockies. Almost 70\% of large fires in RMNP burned during La Nin˜a events that coincided with a negative PDO, although these phases co-occurred during only 29\% of the 1700– 1975 period. Spatial teleconnection patterns between drought, PDO and ENSO across western North America independently support the sign and strength of relationships between these climatic anomalies and subalpine fire occurrence along a broad north–south gradient of the Rockies. Forecasts of ENSO that are dependent on the expected PDO phase suggest promise for fire hazard prediction across the West.},

Anorogenic magmatism, including flood basalts, dike swarms, anorthosite massifs and granite-rhyolite provinces, originated along the Laurentian and Gondwanan rift tessellations. Long-lived volcanic regions of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, sometimes called hotspots, originated near triple junctions of the Gondwanan tessellation as the supercontinent broke apart.

@article{Sharp2012,
 abstract = {The Namibe Basin is the southern-most of the Angolan Atlantic margin salt basins; an oblique rifted margin, essentially the conjugate to the hydrocarbon prolific Santos Basin of Brazil. Onshore outcrops are limited to a narrow (20 km wide) elongate (150 km long) coastal strip, occurring at the very edge of the South Atlantic rift. Incised drainage and an arid climate afford good outcrop conditions, allowing a unique insight into Pre- and Post-Salt successions. In this contribution we present the results of a collaborative Sonangol-Statoil study addressing the Namibe Basin. Specifically, we show 2 case studies on fault-related carbonates; 1 Pre-Salt and 1 Post-Salt. The first rift-related deposits are interbedded basalts (dated 133 Ma), rhyolites and aeolian-alluvial clastics exposed in a series of tilted fault blocks. Overlying the volcanics are an unusual set of outcrops including fissure ridge and "dam and cascade" carbonates (travertine's) and associated lacustrine sediments. The travertines are spatially related to extensional-transtensional faults, and typically have "cascade" morphologies, draping underlying topography. Lacustrine units are spatially confined to topographic lows, typically hangingwall basins, and are spatially limited in extent (5-15 m thick, 200 m to 2 km laterally). Hangingwall basin fills are mixed carbonate-clastic. At 2 locations a lateral passage from travertine to lacustrine facies can be mapped. Secondary diagenesis is complex, including dolomitisation, silicification and exotic hydrothermal cements. Post-salt non-marine carbonates are associated with a second period of igneous activity (dated 88 ma). Multiple volcanic centres can be mapped, again spatially related to faults. Both sub areal and submarine flows are exposed. In the sub areal settings spring mound and fissure ridge carbonates are spectacularly developed, associated with extensional faults. Individual fracture-fed cascades can be mapped into hangingwall basins, where they pass into mixed carbonate-clastic sediments, including locally well developed coquina facies. Secondary diagenesis is again marked, with silicification spatially linked to vents. The two case studies give an insight into the important link between igneous activity, faulting and non-marine carbonate deposition; analogy can be drawn to the enigmatic Pre-Salt reservoirs of the South Atlantic. Volumetrically however, the described examples do not form significant reservoir bodies.},

 abstract = {Through the use of seismic reflection profiles, satellite images, and balanced kinematic models, we describe patterns that help to identify imbricate structures and define the sequence of thrusting in fold-andthrust belts. Measures of folding shear strains are employed to define break-forward systems in which younger, deeper faults refold overlying thrust sheets. In contrast, break-backward sequences form a wide range of viable geometries that are not expected to conserve these folding strains. Thus, measures of folding shear strains provide a means to define thrusting sequence. We also explore map-view patterns of imbricate thrusting by using three-dimensional models and stereoscopic satellite images. We present an example from the Peruvian Andes in which these map patterns are combined with seismic reflection profiles to define a complex imbricate system with components of both breakforward and break-backward thrusting. These integrated methods provide new tools for understanding the deformational histories of fold-and-thrust belts, including the definition of complex structural closures with opportunities for hydrocarbon-reservoir duplication.},

This tutorial does not shy away from explaining the ideas informally, nor does it shy away from the mathematics. The hope is that by addressing both aspects, readers of all levels will be able to gain a better understanding of PCA as well as the when, the how and the why of applying this technique.},

 abstract = {We have studied shrinkage-crack patterns which form when a thin layer of an alumina/water slurry dries. Both isotropic and directional drying were studied. The dynamics of the pattern formation process and the geometric properties of the isotropic crack patterns are similar to what is expected from recent models, assuming weak disorder. There is some evidence of a gradual increase in disorder as the drying layer become thinner, but no sudden transition, in contrast to what has been seen in previous experiments. The morphology of the crack patterns is influenced by drying gradients and front propagation effects, with sharp gradients having a strong orienting and ordering effect.},

@book{Showman2013,
 abstract = {The investigation of planets around other stars began with the study of gas giants, but is now extending to the discovery and characterization of super-Earths and terrestrial planets. Motivated by this observational tide, we survey the basic dynamical principles governing the atmospheric circulation of terrestrial exoplanets, and discuss the interaction of their circulation with the hydrological cycle and global-scale climate feedbacks. Terrestrial exoplanets occupy a wide range of physical and dynamical conditions, only a small fraction of which have yet been explored in detail. Our approach is to lay out the fundamental dynamical principles governing the atmospheric circulation on terrestrial planets--broadly defined--and show how they can provide a foundation for understanding the atmospheric behavior of these worlds. We first survey basic atmospheric dynamics, including the role of geostrophy, baroclinic instabilities, and jets in the strongly rotating regime (the "extratropics") and the role of the Hadley circulation, wave adjustment of the thermal structure, and the tendency toward equatorial superrotation in the slowly rotating regime (the "tropics"). We then survey key elements of the hydrological cycle, including the factors that control precipitation, humidity, and cloudiness. Next, we summarize key mechanisms by which the circulation affects the global-mean climate, and hence planetary habitability. In particular, we discuss the runaway greenhouse, transitions to snowball states, atmospheric collapse, and the links between atmospheric circulation and CO2 weathering rates. We finish by summarizing the key questions and challenges for this emerging field in the future.},

 abstract = {Amphibole crystallization from hydrous high-magnesium andesite (Shiveluch volcano, Kamchatka) melt has been studied experimentally at pressures 2, 3, 5 kbar. Slightly subliquidus temperatures have been selected for amphibole crystallization. Amphiboles with close to the equilibrium composition have been obtained at low undercoolings in short 4 hours experiments. We select octahedral aluminium content and sum of high charged cations (Ti4+, Fe3+) all evaluated with the 13eCNK method as master parameters reflecting pressure of amphibole formation. Asymptotic maximum of AlVI content at the sum Ti+Fe3+ =0 as a function of pressure was calculated following negative linear correlation trend for each run of the original and published experimental data sets. The derived novel AlVI in amphibole barometer is calibrated in the pressure range of 2-12 kbar for andesitic and basaltic magmas. Reliability and validity of the new geobarometer were tested on the amphibolized ultramafic xenoliths from the Shiveluch Volcano (Kamchatka) and Dish Hill (California). In both cases our estimates appear to be equal within the uncertainty of the method to the predictions done by two-pyroxene geo-thermo-barometer (Putirka, 2008).},

 abstract = {The program adiabat\_1ph is a simple text-menu driver for subroutine versions of the algorithms MELTS, pMELTS, and pHMELTS [ Asimow et al., 2004; Ghiorso et al., 2002; Ghiorso and Sack, 1995]. It may be used to calculate equilibrium assemblages along a thermodynamic path set by the user and can simultaneously calculate trace element distributions. The MELTS family of algorithms is suitable for multicomponent systems, which may be anhydrous, water-undersaturated, or water-saturated, with the options of buffering oxygen fugacity and/or water activity. A wide variety of calculations can be performed either subsolidus or with liquid(s) present; melting and crystallization may be batch, fractional, or continuous. The software is suitable for Linux, MacOS X, and Windows, and many aspects of program execution are controlled by environment variables. Perl scripts are also provided that may be used to invoke adiabat\_1ph with some command line options and to produce output that may be easily imported into spreadsheet programs, such as Microsoft Excel. Benefits include a batch mode, which allows almost complete automation of the calculation process when suitable input files are written. This technical brief describes version 1.04, which is provided as ancillary material. Binaries, scripts, documentation, and example files for this and future releases may be downloaded at http://www.gps.caltech.edu/\&\#8764;asimow/adiabat. On a networked computer, adiabat\_1ph automatically checks whether a newer version is available.},

 abstract = {The Zavkhan terrane in western Mongolia preserves thick, fossiliferous, carbonate-rich strata that span the Ediacaran-Cambrian transition. Measured stratigraphic sections and geological mapping of these strata, which include the Zuun-Arts, Bayangol, Salaagol, and Khairkhan Formations, reveal large lateral facies changes over short distances that necessitate revisions to previous lithostratigraphic correlations and biostratigraphic range charts. Here, we integrate new geological mapping and measured stratigraphic sections across the Zavkhan terrane with high-resolution carbon isotope (δ13C) chemostratigraphy, sequence stratigraphy, and biostratigraphy. Using these data, we revise correlations within the Zavkhan terrane and place small shelly fossil and ichnofossil horizons in a refined temporal and spatial framework. Finally, we integrate these data from Mongolia with absolute ages and chemostratigraphy from sections in Morocco and Oman. Our revised age model suggests that deposition of the Bayangol Formation and the lower part of the Salaagol Formation was limited to the Nemakit-Daldynian and Tommotian Stages.With the new correlations and age model, we place the small shelly fossil first appearance datum in the basal Bayangol Formation instead of the basal Zuun-Arts Formation, which moves this horizon hundreds of meters higher in the stratigraphy, above the large negative excursion in the Zuun-Arts Formation. The first appearance datum of Treptichnus pedum is ∼275 m above the large negative excursion in the Zuun-Arts Formation and ∼250 m above the first appearance datum of small shelly fossils, highlighting the rarity and facies dependence of its preservation.We shift the first appearance datums of tommotiids, orthothecimorphs, hyolithelminths, cap-shaped fossils, protoconodonts, and Salanacus to just below the positive peak 3p. This interpretation differs from previous chronostratigraphic placements of first appearance data of genera between positive excursions 1p and 2p. Using this level as the first appearance datum in Mongolia for these genera, we replot global fossil first appearances. With this new compilation, there are still three distinct pulses of fossil first appearances, as was suggested in previous compilations; however, we suggest that this pattern is controlled largely by regional sedimentation and taphonomy rather than the rate of taxonomic origination.},

 abstract = {During the early Paleogene, climate in continental interiors is thought to have been warmer and more equable than today, but estimates of seasonal temperature variations during this period are limited. Global and regional climate models of the Paleogene predict cooler temperatures for continental interiors than are implied by proxy data and predict a seasonal range of temperature that is similar to today. Here, we present a record of summer temperatures derived from carbonate clumped isotope thermometry of paleosol carbonates from Paleogene deposits in the Bighorn Basin, Wyoming (United States). Our summer tem- perature estimates are ̃18 °C greater than mean annual temperature estimated from analy- sis of fossil leaves. When coupled, these two records yield a seasonal range of temperature similar to that in the region today, with winter temperatures that are near freezing. These data are consistent with our high-resolution climate model output for the Early Eocene in the Bighorn Basin. We suggest that temperatures in continental interiors during the early Paleogene greenhouse were warmer in all seasons, but not more equable than today. If gen- erally true, this removes one of the long-standing paradoxes in our understanding of ter- restrial climate dynamics under greenhouse conditions. INTRODUCTION},

@article{Soare2017,
 abstract = {On Mars, so-called “scalloped depressions” are widely observed in Utopia Planitia (UP) and Malea Planum (MP). Typically, they are rimless, metres- to decametres-deep, incised sharply, tiered inwardly, polygonised and sometimes pitted. The depressions seemingly incise terrain that is icy and possibly thermokarstic, i.e. produced by the thermal destabilisation of the icy terrain. Agewise, the depressions are thought to be relatively youthful, originating in the Late Amazonian Epoch. Here, we report the presence of similar depressions in the Argyre region (AR) (30–60° S; 290–355° E). More importantly, we separate and differentiate these landforms into two groups: (ice-rich) periglacial depressions (Type-1); and, (icy) glacial depressions (Type-2a-c). This differentiation is presented to the Mars community for the first time. Based on a suite of morphological and geological characteristics synonymous with ice-complexes in the Lena Peninsula (eastern Russia) and the Tuktoyaktuk Coastlands (Northwest Territories, Canada), we propose that the Type-1 depressions are ice-rich periglacial basins that have undergone volatile depletion largely by sublimation and as the result of thermal destabilisation. In keeping with the terms and associated definitions derived of terrestrial periglacial-geomorphology, ice-rich refers to permanently frozen-ground in which ice lenses or segregation ice (collectively referenced as excess ice) have formed. We suggest that the depressions are the product of a multi-step, cold-climate geochronology: (1) Atmospheric precipitation and surface accumulation of an icy mantle during recent high obliquities.(2) Regional or local triple-point conditions and thaw/evaporation of the mantle, either by exogenic forcing, i.e. obliquity-driven rises of aerial and sub-aerial temperatures, or endogenic forcing, i.e. along Argyre impact-related basement structures.(3) Meltwater migration into the regolith, at least to the full depth of the depressions.(4) Freeze-thaw cycling and the formation of excess ice.(5) Sublimation of the excess ice and depression formation as high obliquity dissipates and near-surface ice becomes unstable.The Type-2 depressions exhibit characteristics suggestive of (supra-glacial) dead-ice basins and snow/ice suncups observed in high-alpine landscapes on Earth, e.g. the Swiss Alps and the Himalayas. Like the Type-1 depressions, the Type-2 depressions could be the work of sublimation; however, the latter differ from the former in that they seem to develop within a glacial-like icy mantle that blankets the surface rather than within an ice-rich and periglacially-revised regolith at/near the surface. Interestingly, the Type-2 depressions overlie the Type-1 depressions at some locations. If the periglacial/glacial morphological and stratigraphical dichotomy of depressions is valid, then this points to recent glaciation at some locations within the AR being precursed by at least one episode of periglaciation. This also suggests that periglaciation has a deeper history in the region than has been thought hitherto. Moreover, if the hypothesised differences amongst the Argyre-based depressions are mirrored in Utopia Planitia and Malea Planum, then perhaps this periglacial-glacial dichotomy and its associated geochronology are as relevant to understanding late period landscape-evolution in these two regions as it is in the AR?},

 abstract = {pThe paper presents an algorithm for reconstruction of 3D circle from its apparition in in/i images. It supposes that camera poses are known up to an uncertainty. They will be considered as observations and will be refined during the reconstruction process. First, circle apparitions will be estimated in every individual image from a set of 2D points using a constrained optimization. Uncertainty of 2D points are propagated in 2D ellipse estimation and leads to covariance matrix of ellipse parameters. In 3D reconstruction process ellipse and camera pose parameters are considered as observations with known covariances. A minimal parametrization of 3D circle enables to model the projection of circle in image without any constraint. The reconstruction is performed by minimizing the length of observation residuals vector in a non linear Gauss-Helmert model. The output consists in parameters of the corresponding circle in 3D and their covariances. The results are presented on simulated data./p},

 abstract = {Isidis Planitia is a 1350 km wide impact crater located close to the martian equator. To test the hypothesis that the 2.8 to 3.4 Ga old Thumbprint Terrain preserved on the floor of this basin is a glacial landform assemblage, we perform a numerical simulation of glaciation with a thermo-mechanically coupled model of ice sheet dynamics. As model inputs, we use surface temperatures and ice accumulation patterns predicted by a General Circulation Model based on the present-day atmospheric characteristics, and values of the geothermal heat flux provided by a global model of planetary thermal evolution. We find that, under favorable orbital conditions, an ice sheet covering the entire basin can develop in 2 to 5 Ma, with a maximum thickness of 4.9 km. The modeled ice sheet is polythermal: it is permanently cold-based in the periphery and, due to a negative heat-flux anomaly, also in the center, while the pressure melting point is reached in an intermediate ring. Our simulation is consistent with the interpretation that the Thumbprint Terrain is a martian equivalent of terrestrial ribbed moraines and has formed below a wet-based ice sheet. It supports also the interpretation that sinuous ridges and linear valleys observed at the periphery of the basin are parts of a subglacial network of eskers and tunnel valleys that drained the glacial meltwater outwards, across the cold-based periphery of the ice sheet. This work strengthens the hypothesis that glaciers thick as much as several km may have existed on Mars several Ga ago and that glacial basal melting may have contributed to the production and flow of surface liquid water at that time, under an atmosphere no thicker than the present-day one.},

 abstract = {U-Pb detrital zircon ages from Mesoproterozoic and Cambrian siliciclastic units in west Texas (USA) constrain the depositional setting, provenance, and tectonic history of the region within a late Mesoproterozoic Grenville foreland basin and the early Paleozoic Sauk transgressive sequence. Two key units, the Hazel and Lanoria Formations, have detrital zircon age spectra dominated by detritus derived from the Grenville orogen (the Llano uplift and eroded equivalents), the ca. 1.4 Ga Granite-Rhyolite, and the ca. 1.7-1.6 Ga Yavapai/Mazatzal provinces. These data, combined with sedimentological data, permit interpreting those formations as the proximal and distal deposits, respectively, of a molasse shed into the Grenvillian foreland basin. Detrital zircons as young as ca. 520 Ma show that the Van Horn Formation, previously considered to be Precambrian in age, is no older than middle Cambrian. Further, the overall detrital zircon age spectrum of the Van Horn Formation is similar to that of the overlying Cambro-Ordovician Bliss Formation: both indicate derivation from sources that included the Colorado-Oklahoma aulacogen, Grenville, Granite-Rhyolite, and Yavapai/Mazatzal provinces. The similarities between the depositional history of the Van Horn and Bliss Formations lead us to conclude that the base of the Sauk Sequence in west Texas occurs at the base of the Van Horn Formation. Base-level rise associated with the Sauk transgression affected drainage patterns and sediment deposition along southwestern Laurentia some 20 m.y. earlier than previously assumed.},

A stratigraphic section more than seven meters thick measured in Endurance crater is dominated by eolian dune and sand sheet facies; the uppermost half meter, however, exhibits festoon cross lamination at a length scale that indicates subaqueous deposition, likely in a playa-like interdune setting. Silicates and sulfate minerals dominate outcrop geochemistry, but hematite and Fe3D3 (another ferric iron phase) make up as much as 11\% of the rocks by weight. Jarosite in the outcrop matrix indicates precipitation at low pH. Cements, hematitic concretions, and crystal molds attest to a complex history of early diagenesis, mediated by ambient ground waters.

 abstract = {This study provides the first systematic comparison of orbital facies maps with detailed ground-based geology observations from the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) Curiosity rover to examine the validity of geologic interpretations derived from orbital image data. Orbital facies maps were constructed for the Darwin, Cooperstown, and Kimberley waypoints visited by the Curiosity rover using High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) images. These maps, which represent the most detailed orbital analysis of these areas to date, were compared with rover image-based geologic maps and stratigraphic columns derived from Curiosity's Mast Camera (Mastcam) and Mars Hand Lens Imager (MAHLI). Results show that bedrock outcrops can generally be distinguished from unconsolidated surficial deposits in high-resolution orbital images and that orbital facies mapping can be used to recognize geologic contacts between well-exposed bedrock units. However, process-based interpretations derived from orbital image mapping are difficult to infer without known regional context or observable paleogeomorphic indicators, and layer-cake models of stratigraphy derived from orbital maps oversimplify depositional relationships as revealed from a rover perspective. This study also shows that fine-scale orbital image-based mapping of current and future Mars landing sites is essential for optimizing the efficiency and science return of rover surface operations.},

 abstract = {Determining the oxygen fugacity of Earth's silicate mantle is of prime importance because it affects the speciation and mobility of volatile elements in the interior and has controlled the character of degassing species from the Earth since the planet's formation. Oxygen fugacities recorded by garnet-bearing peridotite xenoliths from Archaean lithosphere are of particular interest, because they provide constraints on the nature of volatile-bearing metasomatic fluids and melts active in the oldest mantle samples, including those in which diamonds are found. Here we report the results of experiments to test garnet oxythermobarometry equilibria under high-pressure conditions relevant to the deepest mantle xenoliths. We present a formulation for the most successful equilibrium and use it to determine an accurate picture of the oxygen fugacity through cratonic lithosphere. The oxygen fugacity of the deepest rocks is found to be at least one order of magnitude more oxidized than previously estimated. At depths where diamonds can form, the oxygen fugacity is not compatible with the stability of either carbonate- or methane-rich liquid but is instead compatible with a metasomatic liquid poor in carbonate and dominated by either water or silicate melt. The equilibrium also indicates that the relative oxygen fugacity of garnet-bearing rocks will increase with decreasing depth during adiabatic decompression. This implies that carbon in the asthenospheric mantle will be hosted as graphite or diamond but will be oxidized to produce carbonate melt through the reduction of Fe(3+) in silicate minerals during upwelling. The depth of carbonate melt formation will depend on the ratio of Fe(3+) to total iron in the bulk rock. This 'redox melting' relationship has important implications for the onset of geophysically detectable incipient melting and for the extraction of carbon dioxide from the mantle through decompressive melting.},

 abstract = {In the Damara Orogen sedimentary basinal responses are important in recording the evolution of the fold belt. Here we integrate sedimentological patterns and tectonics to characterise the basin development of both the pre- to syn-orogenic Damara Sequence and the syn- to post-orogenic Nama Group. The evolution of an entire Late Proterozoic Wilson Cycle involved initial rifting, with the opening of two oceanic arms through convergence to collision and foreland basin development. Rift initiation (stage 1) took place along old tectonic weaknesses and extensional rift basins (stage 2) were filled by continental sediments and alkaline/bimodal volcanics. Two oceanic openings occurred: (i) the Adamastor Ocean (stage 3) produced a break-up unconformity and eastward transgression over the Kalahari and Congo Cratons; and (ii) the Khomas Sea gulf subsequently developed betwen the two cratons (stage 4) and is associated with break-up unconformities, and ultimately the development of mature shleves (stage 5). In the latter opening, we envisage an anticlockwise rotation of the Kalahari Craton with respect to the Congo Craton. During convergence the closing Khomas Sea produced an accretionary prism/arc/retro-arc system (stage 6) and the first deformation phase in the Southern Zone. The Khomas Orogeny records the collision between the Kalahari and Congo Cratons (stage 7) including the obduction of oceanic elements onto the Kalahari Craton foreland, and caused the second and third deformation phases in the Southern Zone and first and second deformation phases in the Central Zone. A peripheral foreland basin and peripheral bulge on the Kalahari Craton resulted, which respectively contained and affected the marine and fluvial Nama Group sedimentation. A complementary hinterland basin accepted Mulden Group sediments on the Congo Craton. Ultimately the collision of the South American continent with the newly reconstituted African foreland (stage 8) caused the Adamastor Orogeny and produced a peripheral foreland basin. This basin was divided into two parts by the extant Khomas mountain belt. This event resulted in a dominant westerly source for the fluvial Fish River Subgroup and exclusion of previous marine conditions. We distinguish for the first time, the temporal separation of the Khomas and Khomas and Adamstor Orogenesis. The Khomas Orogeny involved the subduction of hot young oceanic crust associated with the relatively short residence time of the Khomas Sea, and can be dated at just before the Precambrian-Cambrian boundary. In contrast, the Adamastor Ocean had a residence time of about 200 M.a. Convergence therefore involved the subduction of cooled oceanic crust and incorporation of exotic terranes. Collision was associated with relatively major translation of tectonostratigraphic units. The Adamastor Orogeny occurred close to 500 M.a. © 1991.},

@article{Stern2011,
 abstract = {Subduction erosion occurs at all convergent plate boundaries, even if they are also accretionary margins. Frontal subduction erosion results from a combination of erosion and structural collapse of the forearc wedge into the trench, and basal subduction erosion by abrasion and hydrofracturing above the subduction channel. High rates of subduction erosion are associated with relatively high convergence rates (60mm/yr) and low rates of sediment supply to the trench (40km2/yr), implying a narrow and topographically rough subduction channel which is neither smoothed out nor lubricated by fine-grained water-rich turbidites such as are transported into the mantle below accreting plate boundaries. Rates of subduction erosion, which range up to 440km3/km/my, vary temporally as a function of these same factors, as well as the subduction of buoyant features such as seamount chains, submarine volcanic plateaus, island arcs and oceanic spreading ridge, due to weakening of the forearc wedge. Revised estimates of long-term rates of subduction erosion appropriate for selected margins, including SW Japan (???30km3/km/my since 400Ma), SW USA (???30km3/km/my since 150Ma), Peru and northern Chile (50-70km3/km/my since 150Ma), and central (115km3/km/my since 30Ma) and southernmost Chile (30-35km3/km/my since 15Ma), are higher than in previous compilations. Globally, subduction erosion is responsible for 1.7Armstrong Units (1AU=1km3/yr) of crustal loss, 33\% of the ̃5.25AU of yearly total crustal loss, and more than any one other of sediment subduction (1.65AU), continental lower crustal delamination (???1.1AU), crustal subduction during continental collision (0.4AU), and/or subduction of rock-weathering generated chemical solute that is dissolved in oceanic crust (0.4AU). The paucity of pre-Neoproterozoic blueschists suggests that global rates of subduction erosion were probably greater in the remote past, perhaps due to higher plate convergence rates. Subducted sediments and crust removed from the over-riding forearc wedge by subduction erosion may remain in the crust by being underplated below the wedge, or these crustal debris may be carried deeper into the source region of arc magmatism and incorporated into arc magmas by either dehydration of the subducted slab and the transport of their soluble components into the overlying mantle wedge source of arc basalts, and/or bulk melting of the subducted crust to produce adakites. In selected locations such as in Chile, Costa Rica, Japan and SW USA, strong cases can be made for the temporal and spatial correlations of distinctive crustal isotopic characteristics of arc magmas and episodes or areas of enhanced subduction erosion. Nevertheless, overall most subducted crust and sediment, 90\% (3.0AU), is transported deeper into the mantle and neither underplated below the forearc wedge nor incorporated in arc magmas. The total current rate of return of continental crust into the deeper mantle, the most important process for which is subduction erosion, is equal to or greater than the estimates of the rate at which the crust is being replaced by arc and plume magmatic activity, indicating that currently the continental crust is probably slowly shrinking. However, rates of crustal growth may have been episodically more rapid in the past, most likely at times of supercontinent breakup, and conversely, rates of crustal destruction may have also been higher during times of supercontinent amalgamation. Thus the supercontinent cycle controls the relative rates of growth and/or destruction of the continental crust. Subduction erosion plays an important role in producing and maintaining this cycle by transporting radioactive elements from the crust into the mantle, perhaps as deep as the 670km upper-to-lower mantle transition, or even deeper down to the core-mantle boundary, where heating of this subducted crustal material initiates plumes and superplumes. ?? 2011 International Association for Gondwana Research.},

@article{Stigsson2013,
 abstract = {Measurements of structure orientations are afflicted with uncertainties which arise from many sources. Commonly, such uncertainties involve instrument imprecision, external disturbances and human factors. The aggregated uncertainty depends on the uncertainty of each of the sources. The orientation of an object measured in a borehole (e.g. a fracture) is calculated using four parameters: the bearing and inclination of the borehole and two relative angles of the measured object to the borehole. Each parameter may be a result of one or several measurements. The aim of this paper is to develop a method to both calculate and visualize the aggregated uncertainty resulting from the uncertainty in each of the four geometrical constituents. Numerical methods were used to develop a VBA-application in Microsoft Excel to calculate the aggregated uncertainty. The code calculates two different representations of the aggregated uncertainty: a 1-parameter uncertainty, the 'minimum dihedral angle', denoted by ??; and, a non-parametric visual representation of the uncertainty, denoted by ??. The simple 1-parameter uncertainty algorithm calculates the minimum dihedral angle accurately, but overestimates the probability space that plots as an ellipsoid on a lower hemisphere stereonet. The non-parametric representation plots the uncertainty probability space accurately, usually as a sector of an annulus for steeply inclined boreholes, but is difficult to express numerically. The 1-parameter uncertainty can be used for evaluating statistics of large datasets whilst the non-parametric representation is useful when scrutinizing single or a few objects. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

 abstract = {The calculation of the uncertainty in an estimated rotation requires a parametrization of the rotation group; that is, a unique mapping of the rotation group to a point in 3-D Euclidean space, R3. Numerous parametrizations of a rotation exist, including: (1) the latitude and longitude of the axis of rotation and the angle of rotation; (2) a representation as a Cartesian vector with length equal to the rotation angle and direction parallel to the rotation axis; (3) Euler angles; or (4) unit length quaternions (or, equivalently, Cayley-Klein parameters). The uncertainty in a rotation is determined by the effect of nearby rotations on the rotated data. The uncertainty in a rotation is small, if rotations close to the best fitting rotation degrade the fit of the data by a large amount, and it is large, if only rotations differing by a large amount cause such a degradation. Ideally, we would like to parametrize the rotations in such a way so that their representation as points in R3 would have the property that the distance between two points in R3 reflects the effects of the corresponding rotations on the fit of the data. It can be shown mathematically that this is impossible, but for rotations of small angle, it can be done to close approximation by using vectors in Cartesian coordinates. Thus, we are led to parametrizing the uncertainty separately from the parametrization of the best fitting rotation. This approach results in simpler, more efficient calculations than if uncertainties are described in terms of rotation parameters (i.e., latitude, longitude, and the angle). We illustrate this with the example of equations for determining the uncertainty in a composite rotation from the uncertainties of its constituents.},

 abstract = {Rock falls are common in Yosemite Valley, California, posing substantial hazard and risk to the approximately four million annual visitors to Yosemite National Park. Rock falls in Yosemite Valley over the past few decades have damaged structures and caused injuries within developed regions located on or adjacent to talus slopes, highlighting the need for additional investigations into rock-fall hazard and risk. This assessment builds upon previous investigations of rock fall hazard and risk in Yosemite Valley (Wieczorek et al., 1998, 1999; Guzzetti et al., 2003; Wieczorek et al., 2008), and focuses on hazard and risk to structures posed by relatively frequent fragmental-type rock falls (Evans and Hungr, 1999), up to approximately 100,000 m3 in volume. Previous rock-fall hazard assessments delineated two primary hazard zones in Yosemite Valley defined by: (1) a line delineating the base of rock-fall talus and other slope movement debris, and (2) a line delineating the shadow angle limit (Wieczorek et al., 1998, 1999). The base of talus line encapsulates all rock debris on the valley floor and provides an important first approximation of the hazard, as evidence of past rockfalls (such as talus) is a generally a positive predictor of future rock fall deposition areas. However, by encapsulating all rock debris on the valley floor, the base of talus line mapped by Wieczorek et al. (1998, 1999) does not discriminate between active rock fall and debris flow deposits and inactive rock avalanche and debris flow deposits. Furthermore, as a hazard approximation, the base of talus line does not address the expected progradation of the talus edge as future rock falls accumulate on the talus slope. We define a new rock-fall hazard line by integrating the spatial distribution of individual boulders beyond the base of talus with the inferred frequency of boulder deposition in this region. Debris from most rock falls will come to rest on talus slopes, but some rock falls produce boulders that will travel beyond the base of talus and out onto the valley floor, where substantial park infrastructure exists. The boulders that lie farthest beyond the talus edge presumably indicate the maximum extent of fragmental rock-fall debris since the deglaciation of Yosemite Valley about 15,000 years ago. These “outlying” boulders define a hazard zone that accounts for talus slope progradation and is relevant to developed regions in Yosemite Valley adjacent to active talus slopes. We mapped 258 outlying boulders in 16 study regions throughout Yosemite Valley, and used a statistical approach to define the distances beyond the base of talus that encompass 90\% of the outlying boulders in each region. 90th-percentile distances for the study regions range from 7 to 57 m beyond the mapped base of talus. This statistical analysis defines a probability of outlying boulder deposition, with a 90\% probability that outlying boulders resulting from future fragmental rock falls will be deposited between the talus edge and this line, and a 10\% probability that future rock-fall boulders will be deposited beyond this line. Selection of the 90th-percentile distances, which is based on professional judgment, captures 90\% of the population of outlying boulders while properly excluding true statistical – and potentially anomalous – outliers.},

The LFDB represents only 3.1\% of the total number of Canadian fires during this period, the remaining 96.9\% of fires being suppressed while 200 ha in size, yet accounts for similar to 97\% of the total area burned, allowing a spatial and temporal analysis of recent Canadian landscape-scale fire impacts. On average similar to 2 million ha burned annually in these large fires, although more than 7 million ha burned in some years. Ecozones in the boreal and taiga regions experienced the greatest areas burned, with an average of 0.7\% of the forested land burning annually. Lightning fires predominate in northern Canada, accounting for 80\% of the total LFDB area burned. Large fires, although small in number, contribute substantially to area burned, most particularly in the boreal and taiga regions. The Canadian fire season runs from late April through August, with most of the area burned occurring in June and July due primarily to lightning fire activity in northern Canada. Close to 50\% of the area burned in Canada is the result of fires that are not actioned due to their remote location, low values-at-risk, and efforts to accommodate the natural role of fire in these ecosystems. The LFDB is updated annually and is being expanded back in time to permit a more thorough analysis of long-term trends in Canadian fire activity.},

Additional excursions above the basalt are correlated to patterns globally, including a negative ∼3‰ excursion near the top of the section interpreted as part of the Campanian-Maastrichtian Boundary Events. The age of the basalt ties the studied Bentiaba section to a pulse of Late Cretaceous magmatic activity around the South Atlantic and significant tectonic activity, including rotation, of the African continent. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

 abstract = {The ejecta blankets of impact craters formed on a planetary body that is free of significant quantities of volatiles show substantial differences from those formed on a volatile-rich planetary body. Craters in volatile-rich environments often have layered ejecta blankets with lobe-like ramparts and long runout flows, as seen for Martian impact craters. Under volatile-free conditions, present on the Moon and Mercury, radial textures and patterns, and a gradational decrease in ejecta thickness with distance, can be observed. The Ries crater in Germany is one of the rare impacts on Earth with a preserved ejecta blanket. This crater was previously regarded as an analogue for impact formation on the Moon. Here we demonstrate for the first time that the recent Ries ejecta blanket contains a massive and continuous rampart structure at 1.45–2.12 crater radii from the crater center. Ejecta distribution and thickness, as well as the ejecta fabric, indicate the presence of fluids during the emplacement process. Although Mars differs in atmospheric pressure and water distribution from Earth, the Ries crater shows striking similarities to Martian craters; in particular, those with double-layered ejecta. Consequently, terrestrial impact craters can be better used as analogues for understanding impact formation on Mars than for planetary bodies with volatile-free conditions as seen on the Moon and Mercury.},

This paper tests this hypothesis using ground-penetrating radar techniques. We have identified an expansive radar reflective region spanning approximately 375,000 km 2 in SHAllow RADar (SHARAD) data over western Utopia Planitia. The SHARAD reflective regions coincides with high densities of scalloped depressions and polygonal terrain. The reflectors are associated with layered mesas ∼80–170 m thick. We find a value of 2.8 ± 0.8 for the dielectric constant of the material overlying the reflectors. This work finds that the dielectric constant is consistent with a mixture of ice, air, and dust, containing a water ice volume up to 14,300 km 3 in this unit.},

Here, we report analyses of two 3.56-Gy-old mare basalts demonstrating that they were magnetized in a stable and surprisingly intense dynamo magnetic field of at least ∼13 μT. These data extend the known lifetime of the lunar dynamo by ∼160 My and indicate that the field was likely continuously active until well after the final large basin-forming impact. This likely excludes impact-driven changes in rotation rate as the source of the dynamo at this time in lunar history. Rather, our results require a persistent power source like precession of the lunar mantle or a compositional convection dynamo.},

@article{Sun2012,
 abstract = {The distribution of rare earth elements (REE) between clinopyroxene (cpx) and basaltic melt is important in deciphering the processes of mantle melting. REE and Y partition coefficients from a given cpx-melt partitioning experiment can be quantitatively described by the lattice strain model. We analyzed published REE and Y parti- tioning data between cpx and basaltic melts using the nonlinear regression method and parameterized key parti- tioning parameters in the lattice strain model (D0, r0 and E) as functions of pressure, temperature, and compositions of cpx and melt. D0 is found to positively correlate with Al in tetrahedral site (AlT) and Mg in the M2 site (MgM2)of cpx and negatively correlate with temperature and water content in the melt. r0 is negatively correlated with Al in M1 site (AlM1) and MgM2 in cpx. And E is positively correlated with r0. During adiabatic melting of spinel lherzolite, temperature, AlT, and MgM2 in cpx all decrease systematically as a function of pressure or degree of melting. The competing effects between temperature and cpx composition result in very small variations in REE partition coefficients along a mantle adiabat. A higher potential temperature (1,400?C) gives rise to REE partition coefficients slightly lower than those at a lower potential temperature (1,300?C) because the temperature effect overwhelms the compositional effect. A set of constant REE partition coefficients therefore may be used to accu- rately model REE fractionation during partial melting of spinel lherzolite along a mantle adiabat. As cpx has low Al and Mg abundances at high temperature during melting in the garnet stability field, REE are more incompatible in cpx. Heavy REE depletion in the melt may imply deep melting of a hydrous garnet lherzolite. Water-dependent cpx partition coefficients need to be considered for mod- eling low-degree hydrous melting.},

Comparisons with independent dendroclimatic reconstructions indicate that regionally synchronous fire occurrence was inversely related to yearly fluctuations in precipitation and directly related to decadal-to-centennial variations in temperature. Frequent small fires occurred during a warm period from about A.D. 1000 to 1300, and less frequent but more widespread fires occurred during cooler periods from about A.D. 500 to 1000 and after A.D. 1300. Regionally synchronous fire histories demonstrate the importance of climate in maintaining nonequilibrium conditions.},

 abstract = {The geometry and geologic implications of subducted spreading ridges are topics that have bedeviled earth scientists ever since the recognition of plate tectonics. As a consequence of subduction of the Kula-Farallon and East Pacific rises, slab windows formed and migrated beneath the North American Cordillera. The probable shape and extent of these windows, which represent the asthenosphere-filled gaps between two separating, subducting oceanic plates, are depicted from the Late Cretaceous to the present. Possible effects of the existence and migration of slab windows on the Cordillera at various times include cessation of arc volcanism and replacement by rift or plate- edge volcanism; lithospheric uplift, attenuation, and extension; and increased intensity of compressional tectonism. Eocene extensional tectonism and alkaline magmatism in southern British Columbia and the northwestern United States were facilitated by slab-window development.},

 abstract = {When a mid-ocean spreading ridge subducts, it typically splits apart at depth to form two tapered slab edges separated by asthenospheric mantle within a slab window. We examine the fate of the slab edges using simplified slab window geometries, specific thermal parameters, and assumptions regarding shear stress and slab hydration. Six fundamental zones of slab anatexis are identified and classified according to expected melt and restite compositions. Non-adakitic melts of granodioritic to tonalitic composition are generated along the plate edges at depths of 5-65 km, whereas adakitic melts form proximal to the edges at depths of 25-90 km. As anatexis proceeds, the subducted crust is converted to a migmatite of slab melt and eclogitic restite. Much of the migmatite may shear away from the slab and become incorporated into the mantle. The melts will rise and leave behind fragments of restite within mantle peridotite. If the peridotite is part of the overriding plate, then the restite fragments may become long-term residents of the continental lithospheric mantle. However, if the restite becomes entrained in the asthenosphere, it may undergo upwelling and melting, or flow away as ductile streaks to become long-term mantle heterogeneities. Slab windows are thereby identified as important sites for slab melting and geochemical replenishment of the mantle. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

 abstract = {Recent studies have imaged sharp vertical drops in shear wave velocity at the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB). In some regions, the magnitude of the negative velocity gradient at the LAB is too large to be explained by changes in temperature alone. This study demonstrates that small amounts of partial melt in the shallow asthenosphere are a viable model for this sharp seismic boundary. In particular, we examine melting in the upper asthenosphere at the edge of thick cratonic lithosphere, using the example of eastern North America where a sharp LAB velocity gradient has been observed. Finite element modeling of asthenospheric flow at an abrupt lateral decrease in lithosphere thickness indicates that this geometry, together with lateral plate motions, produces edge-driven convection and asthenospheric upwelling at the continental margin. A key component of this work is a comparison of the locations and extents of melting produced by using different models for the depression of the peridotite solidus with varying H2O content. In addition, we develop a simplified parameterization of the H2O-undersaturated peridotite solidus for a constant degree of H2O saturation in nominally anhydrous minerals. The patterns of mantle flow produced by our numerical modeling and various solidus parameterizations predict less than 0.1 wt \% to 2.8 wt \% (0.01–3.3 vol \%) melting at depths between 102 and 126 km for an asthenosphere with a mantle potential temperature of 1350°C and 150 ppm H2O, or between 91 km and a maximum of 200 km for a mantle at 1350°C and 450 ppm H2O. If the asthenosphere has a mantle potential temperature ≤1340°C or contains less than 150 ppm H2O at 3 GPa, no melting will occur. This process of generating melt in the asthenosphere to produce a sharp vertical velocity gradient at the LAB is viable in other locations where convective upwelling occurs in the shallow asthenosphere although it is dependent on asthenospheric potential temperature, composition, and H2O content. Because the asthenosphere may be heterogeneous in composition and H2O content, the onset of melting below the LAB may fluctuate with time and space, as may the magnitude of the shear velocity drop at the LAB.},

 abstract = {Here we develop a lherzolite melting model and explore the effects of variations in mantle composition, pressure, temperature, and H2O content on melt composition. New experiments and a compilation of experimental liquids saturated with all of the mantle minerals (olivine, orthopyroxene, clinopyroxene, plagioclase and/or spinel) are used to calibrate a model that predicts the temperature and major element composition of a broad spectrum of primary basalt types produced under anhydrous to low H2O-content conditions at upper mantle pressures. The model can also be used to calculate the temperature and pressure at which primary magmas were produced in the mantle, as well as to model both near-fractional adiabatic decompression and batch melting. Our experimental compilation locates the pressure interval of the plagioclase to spinel transition on the solidus and shows that it is narrow (\&\#8764;0.1 GPa) for melting of natural peridotite compositions. The multiple saturation boundaries determined by our model provide a method for assessing the appropriate mineral assemblage, as well as the extent of the fractional crystallization correction required to return a relatively primitive liquid to equilibrium with the mantle source. We demonstrate that an inaccurate fractionation correction can overestimate temperature and depths of melting by hundreds of degrees and tens of kilometers, respectively. This model is particularly well suited to examining the temperature and pressure of origin for intraplate basaltic volcanism and is used to examine the petrogenesis of a suite of Holocene basaltic lavas from Diamond Crater in Oregon's High Lava Plains (HLP).},

This study focuses on basalts with low pre-eruptive H2O contents that are little fractionated near-primary melts of mantle peridotite (i.e., basalts thought to be products of anhydrous decompression mantle melting). Calculated minimum depths of nominally anhydrous melt extraction are 40–58 km below Oregon's HighLava Plains, 41–51 km below theModoc Plateau, and 37–60 kmbelow the central and southern Cascades arc. The calculated depths are very close to Moho depths as determined from a number of regional geophysical studies and suggest that the geophysical Moho and lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary in this region are located in very close proximity to one another (within 5–10 km). The basalts originated at 1185–1383C and point to a generally warm mantle beneath this area but not one hot enough to obviously require a plume contribution. Our results, combined with a range of other geologic, geophysical, and geochemical constraints, are consistent with a regional model whereby anhydrous mantle melting over the last 10.5Ma in a modern convergent margin and back arc was driven by subduction-induced corner flow in the mantle wedge, and to a lesser extent, toroidal flow around the southern edge of the subducting Juan de Fuca and Gorda plates, and crustal extension-related upwelling of the shallow mantle.},

 abstract = {The Grand Canyon Supergroup records at least two distinct periods of intracratonic extension and sedimentation in the late Mesoproterozoic and Neoproterozoic. New 40Ar/39Ar age determinations indicate that the Mesoproterozoic Unkar Group was deposited between ca. 1.2 and 1.1 Ga. Basins in which the Unkar Group was deposited and the related northwest-striking faults were created by northeast-southwest extension, which was contemporaneous with regional northwest-southeast "Grenville" contraction. New U-Pb data indicate that the Neoproterozoic Chuar Group was deposited between 800 and 742 Ma. Sedimentary and tectonic studies show that Chuar deposition took place during east-west extension and resulting normal slip across the Butte fault. This event is interpreted to be an intracratonic response to the breakup of Rodinia and initiation of the Cordilleran rift margin. Laramide monoclines of the Grand Canyon region have north and northwest trends, reactivate faults that originated at the time of Unkar and Chuar deposition, and can be traced for great distances (hundreds of kilometers) from the Grand Canyon. We use the distribution of monoclines in the Southwest to infer the extent of Proterozoic extensional fault systems. The 1.1 Ga northwest-trending structures and ca. 800-700 Ma north-trending extensional structures created regional fault networks that were tectonically inverted during formation of the Ancestral Rocky Mountains and Laramide contraction and reactivated during Tertiary extension.},

 abstract = {The Unkar Group of the Grand Canyon Supergroup is one of the best-preserved remnants of Mesoproterozoic sedimentary rocks in the southwestern United States. It provides an exceptional record of intracratonic basin formation and associated tectonics kinematically compatible with protracted “Grenville-age” NW-directed shortening. New U/Pb age determinations from an air-fall tephra at the base of the Unkar Group dates the onset of deposition at ca. 1255 Ma, and 40Ar/39Ar K-feldspar thermochronology in the Grand Canyon indicates that basement rocks cooled through 150 °C between ca. 1300 and 1250 Ma, refining exhumation rates of basement rocks just prior to Unkar deposition. Abrupt thickness and facies changes in conglomerate and dolomite of the Bass Formation (lower Unkar Group) associated with NE-striking monoclinal flexures indicate NW-directed synsedimentary contraction at ca. 1250 Ma. A large disconformity (∼75 m.y. duration) is inferred between the lower and upper Unkar Group and is located below the upper Hakatai Shale, as documented by detrital zircons. A second style of Unkar Group deformation involved the development of half grabens and full grabens that record NE-SW extension on NW-striking, high-angle normal faults. Several observations indicate that NW-striking normal faulting was concurrent with upper Unkar deposition, mafic magmatism, and early Nankoweap deposition: (1) intraformational faulting in the Bass Formation, (2) intraformational faulting in the 1070 Ma (old Rb/Sr date) Cardenas Basalt and lower Nankoweap Formation, (3) syntectonic relationships between Dox deposition and 1104 Ma (new Ar/Ar date) diabase intrusion, and (4) an angular unconformity between Unkar Group and Nankoweap strata. The two tectonic phases affecting the Unkar Group (ca. 1250 Ma and ca. 1100 Ma) provide new insight into tectonics of southern Laurentia: (1) Laramide-style (monoclines) deformation in the continental interior at ca. 1250 Ma records Grenville-age shortening; and (2) ca. 1100 Ma detrital muscovite (Ar/Ar) and zircon (U/Pb) indicate an Unkar Group source in the Grenville-age highlands of southwestern Laurentia during development of NW-striking extensional basins. We conclude that far-field stresses related to Grenville-age orogenesis (NW shortening and orthogonal NE-SW extension) dominated the sedimentary and tectonic regime of southwestern Laurentia from 1250 to 1100 Ma.},

However, when used on 2-D data such as images, PPCA suffers from the curse of dimensionality due to the subsequently large number of model parameters. To overcome this problem, we propose in this paper a novel probabilistic model on 2-D data called bilinear PPCA (BPPCA). This allows the establishment of a closer tie between BPPCA and its nonprobabilistic counterpart. Moreover, two efficient parameter estimation algorithms for fitting BPPCA are also developed. Experiments on a number of 2-D synthetic and real-world data sets show that BPPCA is more accurate than existing probabilistic and nonprobabilistic dimension reduction methods.},

 abstract = {Principal component analysis (PCA) is one of the most popular techniques for processing, compressing, and visualizing data, although its effectiveness is limited by its global linearity. While nonlinear variants of PCA have been proposed, an alternative paradigm is to capture data complexity by a combination of local linear PCA projections. However, conventional PCA does not correspond to a probability density, and so there is no unique way to combine PCA models. Therefore, previous attempts to formulate mixture models for PCA have been ad hoc to some extent. In this article, PCA is formulated within a maximum likelihood framework, based on a specific form of gaussian latent variable model. This leads to a well-defined mixture model for probabilistic principal component analyzers, whose parameters can be determined using an expectation-maximization algorithm. We discuss the advantages of this model in the context of clustering, density modeling, and local dimensionality reduction, and we demonstrate its application to image compression and handwritten digit recognition.},

The new plate tectonic model is internally consistent and consistent with globally balanced plate motion solutions. The model includes realistic scenarios for intraplate deformation, pre-drift extension and seafloor spreading. Within the model, Aptian salt basins preserved in the South American (Brazilian) and African (Angola, Congo, Gabon) continental shelves are reunited in their original positions as parts of a single syn-rift basin in near subtropical latitudes (10°S–27°S). The basin was dissected at around 112 Ma (Aptian–Albian boundary) when the model suggests that seafloor spreading commenced north of the Walvis Ridge–Rio Grande Rise.

Accordingly, newly discovered regions of saline minerals on Mars are high priority targets for exploration. The chemical divide concept of evaporite mineral formation is used successfully to predict evaporite mineralogy and brine evolution on Earth. However, basaltic weathering largely controls fluid compositions on Mars and the robust predictive capabilities of terrestrial chemical divides cannot be used to interpret Martian evaporites. Here we present a new chemical divide system that predicts evaporite assemblages identified in SNC-type meteorites, ancient evaporites discovered on Meridiani Planum by the Opportunity rover, and Mars Express OMEGA data. We suggest that a common fluid type that has been buffered to different pH levels by basaltic weathering controls the variability among Martian evaporite assemblages and that evaporite mineralogy and brine evolution is essentially established by the initial composition of the dilute evaporating fluid.},

 abstract = {Chemical sediments and the aqueous alteration products of volcanic rocks clearly indicate the presence of water, at least episodically, at the Martian surface. Compared to similar materials formed on the early Earth, however, Martian deposits are juvenile, or diagenetically under-developed. Here we examine the role of water in facilitating various diagenetic reactions and evaluate the predicted effects of time and temperature for aqueous diagenesis on Mars. Using kinetic formulations based on terrestrial sedimentary geology, we quantify the integrated effects of time and temperature for a range of possible burial and thermal histories of precipitated minerals on Mars. From this, we estimate thresholds beyond which these precipitates should have been converted to the point of non-detection in the presence of water. Surface water has been shown to be at least episodically present in recent times. Nonetheless, the integrated duration of aqueous activity recorded over geologically long intervals by hydrated amorphous silica, smectite clays and Fe-sulfate minerals suggests that where these minerals occur water did not persist much beyond their initial deposition. This geochemical conclusion converges with geomorphologic studies that suggest water limitation during the late Noachian–Hesperian peak of valley formation and a still more limited footprint of water since that time. In addition to documenting the presence of water and its chemical properties, a complete assessment of potentially habitable environments on Mars should address the timescales on which liquid water has persisted and the timing of aqueous episodes relative to major planetary events.},

 abstract = {Theoretical analyses suggest that finite-frequency effects should be considered in tomographic inversions of seismic phase arrival times' measured with waveform cross correlation at relatively low frequencies. This has led to the development of so-called banana-doughnut [sensitivity] kernels'--hereinafter BDKs. Here we address a practical question: has the use of these kernels produced tomographic images of global mantle heterogeneity that are significantly better than those based on ray theory? A simple model comparison suggests that the answer is not yet'. The effect of BDKs on both the pattern and the amplitude of mantle wavespeed perturbations appears to be smaller than that of practical (and subjective) considerations (such as the level of damping, the weighting of different data sets, and the choice of data fit) and does not exceed realistic estimates of image uncertainty due to, for instance, errors in the data. By itself, the fact that the better theory has not yet resulted in significant model improvements does not imply that models based on BDKs are incorrect. Deep plumes' may very well exist, but the benificial effect of BDKs on the tomographic images (and on plume' identification in particular) has been overstated.$\backslash$n},

 abstract = {Recent reports of approximately 30 wt\% of sulphate within saline sediments on Mars--probably occurring in hydrated form--suggest a role for sulphates in accounting for equatorial H2O observed in a global survey by the Odyssey spacecraft. Among salt hydrates likely to be present, those of the MgSO4*nH2O series have many hydration states. Here we report the exposure of several of these phases to varied temperature, pressure and humidity to constrain their possible H2O contents under martian surface conditions. We found that crystalline structure and H2O content are dependent on temperature-pressure history, that an amorphous hydrated phase with slow dehydration kinetics forms at 1\% relative humidity, and that equilibrium calculations may not reflect the true H2O-bearing potential of martian soils. Mg sulphate salts can retain sufficient H2O to explain a portion of the Odyssey observations. Because phases in the MgSO4*nH2O system are sensitive to temperature and humidity, they can reveal much about the history of water on Mars. However, their ease of transformation implies that salt hydrates collected on Mars will not be returned to Earth unmodified, and that accurate in situ analysis is imperative.},

 abstract = {Sedimentary rocks at Yellowknife Bay (Gale Crater) on Mars include mudstone sampled by the Curiosity rover. The samples, John Klein and Cumberland, contain detrital basaltic minerals, Ca-sulfates, Fe oxide/hydroxides, Fe-sulfides, amorphous material, and trioctahedral smectites. The John Klein smectite has basal spacing of ̃10 Å indicating little interlayer hydration. The Cumberland smectite has basal spacing at ̃13.2 Å as well as ̃10 Å. The ̃13.2 Å spacing suggests a partially chloritized interlayer or interlayer Mg or Ca facilitating H2O retention. Basaltic minerals in the mudstone are similar to those in nearby eolian deposits. However, the mudstone has far less Fe-forsterite, possibly lost with formation of smectite plus magnetite. Late Noachian/Early Hesperian or younger age indicates that clay mineral formation on Mars extended beyond Noachian time.},

@article{vanSchijndel2011,
 abstract = {The African continental crust was assembled by a series of orogenies over a period of billions of years mainly in Precambrian times. Tracing the build-up history of this stable crust is not always straightforward due to multiphase deformation and regions with poor outcrop. Episodes of metamorphism and magmatism associated with multiple Wilson cycles are recorded in zircons, which found their way into sediments derived from the hinterland. Dating of zircon populations in detrital rocks can hence provide age spectra which reﬂect the metamorphic and magmatic events of the region. Microbeam dating of detrital zircon is used to characterize the crustal development history of the Rehoboth Province of southern Africa. We investigated a quartzite of the Late Palaeo-Early Mesoproterozoic Billstein Formation, formed in a continental basin, and a quartz-feldspar arenite layer of the late Mesoproterozoic Langberg Formation conglomerates, immature sediments formed within a felsic volcanic system (both close to Rehoboth Town). The combined data indicate three episodes of crustal evolution in the Rehoboth Province. The oldest phase is only documented in the Billstein quartzite by three 2.98– 2.7 Ga Archaean zircons. A Palaeoproterozoic phase between 2.2 and 1.9 Ga is older than any known exposures of the Rehoboth Province. The Billstein quartzite shows a main peak at 1.87 Ga, corresponding to the 1863 + 10 Ma Elim Formation. The Langberg sample reﬂects magmatism related to the entire Namaqua–Natal Wilson cycle between c. 1.32 and 1.05 Ga. The absence of zircons of that age range in the Billstein quartzite indicates a pre-Namaqua age for the Billstein Formation. Our data shows that there were at least three episodes of crustal development at 2.98–2.7 Ga, 2.05– 1.75 and 1.32–1.1 Ga. We have documented the existence of a previously unrecognized 2.98– 2.7 Ga Archaean crustal component, which was probably exposed in the Rehoboth Province during the Palaeoproterozoic and thus indicates a much longer geological history for the Rehoboth Province than previously known.},

 abstract = {The Rehoboth Province of southern Africa is deﬁned by its smooth magnetic character by contrast to the adjoining mobile belts. It has been slow to yield information about its crustal evolution because most of it is covered by Kalahari sands. A combined microbeam study of U-Pb, Lu-Hf in zircon from metasedimentary and magmatic rocks of the well-exposed Rehoboth Basement Inlier (RBI) provides new constraints on the crustal evolution of the Rehoboth Province. The detrital zircons provide evidence for ﬁve U-Pb age groups corresponding to magmatic events within the crust, whereas Lu-Hf zircon data allows estimates of crustal residence age. Zircon oxygen isotope data for the magmatic rocks implies diversity in their genesis.},

 abstract = {Since the development of SIMS and LA-ICP-MS technologies in the 1980s and 1990s, single grain U–Pb dating of detrital zircon has quickly become the most popular technique for sedimentary provenance studies. Currently by far the most widespread method for visualising detrital age distributions is the so-called Probability Density Plot (PDP), which is calculated by summing a number of Gaussian distributions whose means and standard deviations correspond to the individual ages and their respective analytical uncertainties. Unfortunately, the PDP lacks a ﬁrm theoretical basis and can produce counter-intuitive results when data quantity (number of analyses) and/or quality (precision) is high. As a more robust alternative to the PDP, this paper proposes a standard statistical technique called Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), which also involves summing a set of Gaussian distributions, but does not explicitly take into account the analytical uncertainties. The Java-based DensityPlotter program (http://densityplotter.london-geochron.com) was developed with the aim to facilitate the adoption of KDE plots in the context of detrital geochronology.},

 abstract = {The Gulf of Kachchh (GoK) is situated in the northeastern Arabian Sea. The presence of several industries along its coastal belt makes GoK a highly sensitive coastal ecosystem. In the present study, an attempt is made for the first time to study GoK thermohaline structure and its variability, based on field measurements and model simulations. Though GoK is considered as a well-mixed system, the study reveals that only the central Gulf is well mixed. Vertical gradients in temperature and salinity fields are noticed in the eastern Gulf, where a cold and high saline tongue is observed in the subsurface layers. Salinity indicates the characteristic feature of an inverse estuary with low values (37.20 psu) near the mouth and high values (40.0 psu) near the head of the Gulf. The model simulated temperature and salinity fields exhibit semidiurnal oscillations similar to that of field observations. Model results show cold, high saline waters advecting from the east during ebb forming a transition zone, which oscillates with tides. A high salinity tongue is seen in the bottom layer, indicating a westward flowing bottom current. The transient zone acts as an dynamic barrier, and plays a vital role in the pollutant transport.},

 abstract = {Determining the temperature distribution within the lithosphere requires the knowledge of the radiogenic heat production (RHP) distribution within the crust and the lithospheric mantle. RHP of crustal rocks varies considerably at different scales as a result of the petrogenetic processes responsible for their formation and therefore RHP depends on the considered lithologies. In this work we address RHP variability of some common lithological groups from a compilation of a total of 2188 representative U, Th and K concentrations of different worldwide rock types derived from 102 published studies. To optimize the use of the generated RHP database we have classified and renamed the rock-type denominations of the original works following a petrologic classification scheme with a hierarchical structure. The RHP data of each lithological group is presented in cumulative distribution plots, and we report a table with the mean, the standard deviation, the minimum and maximum values, and the significant percentiles of these lithological groups.

 abstract = {The investigation of hyperspectral data from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM) and the Observatoire pour la Minéralogie, L'Eau, les Glaces et l'Activitié (OMEGA) on Mars Express has revealed an increasingly diverse suite of minerals present on the Martian surface. A revised set of 60 spectral parameters derived from corrected spectral reflectance at key wavelengths in CRISM targeted observations and designed to capture the known diversity of surface mineralogy on Mars is presented here as “summary products.” Some of the summary products have strong heritage to OMEGA spectral parameter calculations; this paper also presents newly derived parameters that highlight locations with more recently discovered spectral signatures. Type locations for the diversity of currently identified mineral spectral signatures have been compiled into a library presented in this work. Our analysis indicates that the revised set of summary products captures the known spectral diversity of the surface, and successfully highlights and differentiates between locations with differing spectral signatures. The revised spectral parameter calculations and related products provide a useful tool for scientific interpretation and for future mission landing site selection and operations.},

@article{Wade2017,
 abstract = {Despite active transport into Earth’s mantle, water has been present on our planet’s surface for most of geological time1,2. Yet water disappeared from the Martian surface soon after its formation. Although some of the water on Mars was lost to space via photolysis following the collapse of the planet’s magnetic field3,4,5, the widespread serpentinization of Martian crust6,7 suggests that metamorphic hydration reactions played a critical part in the sequestration of the crust. Here we quantify the relative volumes of water that could be removed from each planet’s surface via the burial and metamorphism of hydrated mafic crusts, and calculate mineral transition-induced bulk-density changes at conditions of elevated pressure and temperature for each. The metamorphic mineral assemblages in relatively FeO-rich Martian lavas can hold about 25 per cent more structurally bound water than those in metamorphosed terrestrial basalts, and can retain it at greater depths within Mars. Our calculations suggest that in excess of 9 per cent by volume of the Martian mantle may contain hydrous mineral species as a consequence of surface reactions, compared to about 4 per cent by volume of Earth’s mantle. Furthermore, neither primitive nor evolved hydrated Martian crust show noticeably different bulk densities compared to their anhydrous equivalents, in contrast to hydrous mafic terrestrial crust, which transforms to denser eclogite upon dehydration. This would have allowed efficient overplating and burial of early Martian crust in a stagnant-lid tectonic regime, in which the lithosphere comprised a single tectonic plate, with only the warmer, lower crust involved in mantle convection. This provided an important sink for hydrospheric water and a mechanism for oxidizing the Martian mantle. Conversely, relatively buoyant mafic crust and hotter geothermal gradients on Earth reduced the potential for upper-mantle hydration early in its geological history, leading to water being retained close to its surface, and thus creating conditions conducive for the evolution of complex multicellular life.},

 abstract = {Large discrepancies are reported for the near-solidus, pressure-temperature location of the spinel to garnet lherzolite univariant curve in the system CaO-MgO-Al2O3-SiO2 (CMAS). Experimental data obtained previously from the piston-cylinder apparatus indicate interlaboratory pressure differences of up to 30\% relative. To investigate this disparity-and because this reaction is pivotal for understanding upper mantle petrology-the phase boundary was located by means of an independent method. The reaction was studied via in situ X-ray diffraction techniques in a 6-8 type multianvil press. Pressure is determined by using MgO as an internal standard and is calculated from measured unit cell volume by using a newly developed high-temperature equation of state for MgO. Combinations of real-time and quenched-sample observations are used to bracket the phase transition. The transition between 1350 and 1500??C was reversed, and the reaction was further constrained from 1207 to 1545??C. Within this temperature range, the transition has an average dT/dP slope of ???40 ?? 10??C/kbar, consistent with several previous piston-cylinder studies. Extrapolation of our curve to 1575??C, an established temperature of the P-T invariant point, yields a pressure of 25.1 ?? 1.2 kbar. We also obtained a real-time reversal of the quartz-coesite transition at 30.5 ?? 2.3 kbar at 1357??C, which is about 2 to 4 kbar lower in pressure than previously determined in the piston-cylinder apparatus.

 abstract = {As the Pacific-Farallon spreading center approached North America, the Farallon plate fragmented into a number of small plates. Some of the microplate fragments ceased subducting before the spreading center reached the trench. Most tectonic models have assumed that the subducting oceanic slab detached from these microplates close to the trench, but recent seismic tomography studies have revealed a high-velocity anomaly beneath Baja California that appears to be a fossil slab still attached to the Guadalupe and Magdalena microplates. Here, using surface wave tomography, we establish the lateral extent of this fossil slab and show that it is correlated with the distribution of high-Mg andesites thought to derive from partial melting of the subducted oceanic crust. We also reinterpret the high seismic velocity anomaly beneath the southern central valley of California as another fossil slab extending to a depth of 200 km or more that is attached to the former Monterey microplate. The existence of these fossil slabs may force a reexamination of models of the tectonic evolution of western North America over the last 30 My.},

Tides raised on the earth by the moon have caused an expansion of the lunar orbit. Tides raised on the moon by the earth have de-spun the moon to synchronous rotation and driven its spin axis to a Cassini state-that is, in a coprecessing configuration, coplanar with the lunar orbit normal and the normal to the Laplacian plane (which is at present coincident with the normal to the ecliptic). This combination of events has resulted in a complex history for the lunar spin axis. For much of the period during which its orbital semimajor axis expanded between 30 and 40 earth radii, the obliquity of the moon was of order 25 degrees to 50 degrees . In fact, for a brief period the obliquity periodically attained a value as high as 77 degrees ; that is, the spin axis of the moon was only 13 degrees from lying in its orbit plane.},

 abstract = {The existence of Hesperian age (3.7–3.4 Ga) surface water bodies on Mars is a contentious issue, often conflicting with favored climate models. Extensive lakes are proposed to have filled parts of Valles Marineris during this period, yet evidence for their presence and temporal continuity is poorly constrained. Here we report geomorphic and chronologic evidence for the initiation and demise of a voluminous lake system within the basins of eastern Valles Marineris. We find that independent, kilometer-deep lakes were present here well after the wetter, global climate optimum that characterized the previous Noachian epoch (4.1–3.7 Ga). Relative and impact crater chronologies of flood channels emerging from lake basins indicate relatively late lake spillover in the Early Amazonian (ca. 3.0 Ga). Drawdown of the lake and cessation of interbasin sedimentation may be recorded by a similar Early Amazonian (ca. 3.1 Ga) crater retention age on the surface of Capri Mensa, a 4-km-tall, sulfate-bearing interior layered deposit. The topography data demonstrate that incision of the bedrock barriers between the basins during spillover was driven by a dramatic local base-level difference between the lake surface and downstream basin floors. We postulate that the lake spillover process created an integrated drainage routing system between a voluminous equatorial water supply and the northern plains basin.},

The beds within these deposits have unique variations in brightness, color, mineralogy, and erosional properties that are not typically observed in light-toned layered deposits within Valles Marineris or many other equatorial areas on Mars. Reflectance spectra indicate these deposits contain opaline silica and Fe-sulfates, consistent with low-temperature, acidic aqueous alteration of basaltic materials. We have found valley or channel systems associated with the layered deposits at all five locations, and the volcanic plains adjacent to Juventae, Ius, and Ganges exhibit inverted channels composed of light-toned beds. Valleys, channels, and light-toned layering along the walls of Juventae and Melas Chasmata are most likely coeval to the aqueous activity that affected the adjacent plateaus and indicate some hydrological activity occurred after formation of the chasmata. Although the source of water and sediment remains uncertain, the strong correlation between fluvial landforms and light-toned layered deposits argues for sustained precipitation, surface runoff, and fluvial deposition occurring during the Hesperian on the plateaus adjacent to Valles Marineris and along portions of chasmata walls.},

 abstract = {We have utilized several data sets from multiple spacecraft that have been acquired over a continuous observation campaign across the southwestern Melas Chasma region of Mars. The blocky deposit observed on the chasma floor and on portions of the southern wallrock consists of mixtures of light- and medium-toned materials that exhibit displacement structures consistent with transport down the wallrock and onto the chasma floor. CRISM visible and near-infrared reflectance spectra of the light-toned blocks suggest mixtures of nontronite, jarosite, Al-clays, hydrated silica, and/or an acid leached clay. The medium-toned blocks typically lack spectral features or exhibit signatures of polyhydrated sulfates. Bright layered mounds embayed by blocky deposit materials display spectra consistent with Ca-sulfates (gypsum and/or bassanite) that may have resulted from precipitation of less soluble Ca-rich minerals during ponding and evaporation of dilute fluids along the western chasma floor.Draping across some wallrock slopes is a light-toned deposit that sometimes overlies a blocky, layered, and spectrally bland medium-toned deposit. The light-toned deposit exhibits spectra consistent with mixtures of materials that may include jarosite, acid-leached clays, silica, poorly crystalline clays, and polyhydrated sulfates. Hesperian-age valleys dissect the medium-toned deposit along some wallrock slopes and may be partially filled in by light-toned deposits. The draping nature of these deposits can best be explained by airfall, either volcanic ash or atmospheric dust, with ice/snow accumulation perhaps controlling sedimentation along the wallrock. An examination of other regional hydrated deposits around southwestern Melas indicates similar draping deposits occur farther east and west along the wallrock, whereas layered sulfates to the southeast consist of monohydrated and polyhydrated sulfates that are similar to interior layered deposits found in many of the chasmata. Small opal and jarosite exposures within the Melas basin and along the nearby plateau are most likely the result of younger localized alteration and deposition. The diversity of hydrated minerals and fluvial features indicates multiple episodes of aqueous activity under distinct environmental conditions occurred throughout southwestern Melas Chasma during the Hesperian to Amazonian that may be contemporaneous with late aqueous activity elsewhere on Mars.},

 abstract = {A continuous zone containing pseudotachylites in the Eastern Peninsular Ranges of California extends over more than 15 km from Deep Canyon in the north to at least Toro Canyon in the south. Pseudotachylites are found in rocks of tonalitic to dioritic composition. While the overall compositions of host rock and pseudotachylite veins are similar, veins are characteristically enriched in Fe and Ti and depleted in Si. Many veins are cataclastic, and all contain fragments, but a large number have a groundmass with skeletal and spherulitic microlites of calcic plagioclase (An 40-50), biotite and ilmenite, indicative of partial melting. The pseudotachylites formed mainly during a late brittle event (56-62 Ma) and postdate the high-strain, ductile mylonitic deformation in the Santa Rosa mylonite zone (65-87 Ma) as ascertained by 40Ar/39Ar ages. The size of veins ranges from less than 1 mm to more than 10 cm in thickness and aspect ratios display a broad log-normal distribution. Three-quarters of the veins are more or less parallel to the foliation. The orientation of the veins is consistent with a top to the west displacement, similar to that for the ductile mylonites. From the sizes, energies required for melting are estimated to range between 105 J for smaller veins and 1010 J for larger veins. Interestingly, the energy distribution and geometry of these pseudotachylites correspond closely with energy distributions of current microseismic events along the San Andreas fault at Parkfield, suggesting that basic mechanisms may be similar and due to intrinsic mechanical properties of rocks. In particular these indicate that local stress concentrations, rather than average crustal stresses, are relevant for earthquakes. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

No martian surfaces are older than 4.15 Ga based on crater count statistics, and all are younger than the oldest lunar ones. I show that the heavy bombardment period on the Moon and Mars evolved similarly, but endogenic processes have removed the oldest martian basin record.

 abstract = {Western United States forest wildfire activity is widely thought to have increased in recent decades, yet neither the extent of recent changes nor the degree to which climate may be driving regional changes in wildfire has been systematically documented. Much of the public and scientific discussion of changes in western United States wildfire has focused instead on the effects of 19th- and 20th-century land-use history. We compiled a comprehensive database of large wildfires in western United States forests since 1970 and compared it with hydroclimatic and land-surface data. Here, we show that large wildfire activity increased suddenly and markedly in the mid-1980s, with higher large-wildfire frequency, longer wildfire durations, and longer wildfire seasons. The greatest increases occurred in mid-elevation, Northern Rockies forests, where land-use histories have relatively little effect on fire risks and are strongly associated with increased spring and summer temperatures and an earlier spring snowmelt.},

 abstract = {This article documents the clastic nature of sulphate evaporite beds in the Tithonium Chasma located in the Valles Marineris region of Mars. These beds form a stratified succession characterised by very thick interbedded channel-fill breccia bodies. We infer that the bouldery channel-fills were deposited by voluminous mass-flow processes occurring in a relatively deep subaqueous environment. The redeposition of the coarse-grained evaporite would have responded to phases of high denudation rates in rapidly uplifting hinterlands. Tectonic activity also caused the diapiric uprise and exhumation of evaporite diapirs within the Valles Marineris chasmata, where the apparently young and well development karstic landforms probably formed during the late Amazonian age. These new data strongly suggest the deposition of both primary and resedimented evaporites in a marginal basin area, which effectively restricted ocean access through the proposed "proto-Valles Marineris Strait". The associated ocean may be the "Ocean Borealis" of Late Noachian-Early Hesperian age. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

 abstract = {Mountain topography creates variations in water-table elevation that drive groundwater flow. Consequently, advective heat transport by topography-driven fluid flow can modify the crustal thermal field and bias exhumation rates calculated from thermochronometer data. Although previous studies have considered the thermal effects of fluid flow, none has quantified the influence on thermochronometer ages. We use a steady-state three-dimensional coupled hydraulic thermokinematic finite-element model to simulate the influence of fluid flow on exhumation rates derived from thermochronometer data in the Nepalese Himalaya. Local hot springs suggest substantial heat transport by fluid flow and are adjacent to apatite fission-track samples. Model hydraulic conductivity controls the rate of fluid flow, and values characteristic of fractured rock (\&62;\&62;10\&8722;9 m/s) yield a fluid advection\&8211;dominated thermal field. Hydraulic conductivity is estimated by minimizing the misfit between predicted and observed hot spring thermal power. The best-fit hydraulic conductivity value of \&8764;5 \&215; 10\&8722;7 m/s produces a fluid advection\&8211;dominated thermal field and older predicted apatite fission-track ages. To fit the observed age-elevation relationship, model-predicted ages require denudation rates that are \&8764;5 mm/yr, \&8764;200\&37; higher than predictions from thermal models that do not simulate fluid flow. Thus, true exhumation rates can be substantially underestimated in orogenic systems where fluid advection is significant.},

@article{Whittington2009,
 abstract = {The thermal evolution of planetary crust and lithosphere is largely governed by the rate of heat transfer by conduction. The governing physical properties are thermal diffusivity (kappa) and conductivity (k = kapparhoC(P)), where rho denotes density and C(P) denotes specific heat capacity at constant pressure. Although for crustal rocks both kappa and k decrease above ambient temperature, most thermal models of the Earth's lithosphere assume constant values for kappa ( approximately 1 mm(2) s(-1)) and/or k ( approximately 3 to 5 W m(-1) K(-1)) owing to the large experimental uncertainties associated with conventional contact methods at high temperatures. Recent advances in laser-flash analysis permit accurate (+/-2 per cent) measurements on minerals and rocks to geologically relevant temperatures. Here we provide data from laser-flash analysis for three different crustal rock types, showing that kappa strongly decreases from 1.5-2.5 mm(2) s(-1) at ambient conditions, approaching 0.5 mm(2) s(-1) at mid-crustal temperatures. The latter value is approximately half that commonly assumed, and hot middle to lower crust is therefore a much more effective thermal insulator than previously thought. Above the quartz alpha-beta phase transition, crustal kappa is nearly independent of temperature, and similar to that of mantle materials. Calculated values of k indicate that its negative dependence on temperature is smaller than that of kappa, owing to the increase of C(P) with increasing temperature, but k also diminishes by 50 per cent from the surface to the quartz alpha-beta transition. We present models of lithospheric thermal evolution during continental collision and demonstrate that the temperature dependence of kappa and C(P) leads to positive feedback between strain heating in shear zones and more efficient thermal insulation, removing the requirement for unusually high radiogenic heat production to achieve crustal melting temperatures. Positive feedback between heating, increased thermal insulation and partial melting is predicted to occur in many tectonic settings, and in both the crust and the mantle, facilitating crustal reworking and planetary differentiation.},

 abstract = {Clementine five-channel UV-visible (UVVIS) data have been used to study seven regional dark mantle deposits (DMDs) on the Moon. The DMDs were mapped in distribution to determine their extent and stratigraphic relationship to other geologic units. Based upon the spectral properties for each DMD, the crystallization of the beads in each deposit was inferred and used to estimate cooling rates in the volcanic plumes that emplaced the deposits. Deposits with a high concentration of glasses reflect volcanic plumes that had low optical densities and high cooling rates, whereas deposits dominated by crystallized beads indicate plumes with slower cooling rates due to higher optical densities. Spectral data from each of the regional DMDs show that their glass:crystallized bead ratio can be estimated based upon their 415/750 and 750/950 nm values and comparison to laboratory spectra for the beads. Patches of young dark mantle in the Sinus Aestuum DMD represent one extreme with the bluest color (highest 415/750) and weakest glass band absorption (lowest 750/950) of all the DMDs. At the other extreme is the Aristarchus Plateau DMD with the reddest color and strongest glass band absorption. The other nearside DMDs, including Taurus-Littrow, Sulpicius Gallus, Rima Bode, and Mare Vaporum lie between these two extremes due to intermediate mixtures of the crystallized beads and glasses with other local soils. The Orientale Ring DMD on the western limb is dominated by volcanic glasses and is spectrally similar to the localized DMDs found in Alphonsus crater. We have identified a central vent for the Orientale Ring DMD and model the eruption as degassing of a near-surface dike to produce a 20-km-high umbrella-shaped plume with ejection velocities of 360 m/s and deposition of the glasses at an average radius of 80 km from the vent. Although we cannot identify the exact sources for the other regional DMDs (probably because they are buried beneath younger mare), the eruptions most likely resulted from dikes breaching the surface and producing a volcanic plume dominated by larger (greater than submillimeter) hot clasts that formed mare and sinuous rilles. The small percent of clasts that form the volcanic beads are carried by the expanding gas cloud to large distances, in some cases 100 km, to produce the observed continuous regional DMDs. The lack of basalt samples that can be petrologically related to the volcanic glasses may be a result of their spatial separation, with the basalts flowing into the basins while the beads are deposited both into the basins and on the adjacent highlands.},

@article{Willenbring2010,
 abstract = {Over geologic timescales, CO(2) is emitted from the Earth's interior and is removed from the atmosphere by silicate rock weathering and organic carbon burial. This balance is thought to have stabilized greenhouse conditions within a range that ensured habitable conditions. Changes in this balance have been attributed to changes in topographic relief, where varying rates of continental rock weathering and erosion are superimposed on fluctuations in organic carbon burial. Geological strata provide an indirect yet imperfectly preserved record of this change through changing rates of sedimentation. Widespread observations of a recent (0-5-Myr) fourfold increase in global sedimentation rates require a global mechanism to explain them. Accelerated uplift and global cooling have been given as possible causes, but because of the links between rates of erosion and the correlated rate of weathering, an increase in the drawdown of CO(2) that is predicted to follow may be the cause of global climate change instead. However, globally, rates of uplift cannot increase everywhere in the way that apparent sedimentation rates do. Moreover, proxy records of past atmospheric CO(2) provide no evidence for this large reduction in recent CO(2) concentrations. Here we question whether this increase in global weathering and erosion actually occurred and whether the apparent increase in the sedimentation rate is due to observational biases in the sedimentary record. As evidence, we recast the ocean dissolved (10)Be/(9)Be isotope system as a weathering proxy spanning the past approximately 12 Myr (ref. 14). This proxy indicates stable weathering fluxes during the late-Cenozoic era. The sum of these observations shows neither clear evidence for increased erosion nor clear evidence for a pulse in weathered material to the ocean. We conclude that processes different from an increase in denudation caused Cenozoic global cooling, and that global cooling had no profound effect on spatially and temporally averaged weathering rates.},

We have identified eleven fan-shaped landforms that reflect various depositional environments. A distinctive marker bed with inferred indurated aeolian bedforms is within the stratigraphic record of presumed lacustrine deposits. This observation, taken together with the stratigraphic succession of fan-shaped deposits indicates fluctuating lake levels with, at a minimum, early and late-stage lake highstands. Tributary drainage pattern in the western valley network changed from a dendritic to a meandering system, recording a shift in fluvial activity that is consistent with fluctuating lake levels. Only a few hydrated minerals have been detected in the study region, the most common being opal which appears to represent younger alteration and deposition within the basin. Landform scale was used to estimate average discharge (̃30m3/s), formative discharge (200-300m3/s), and fan formation timescale, which further inform the duration of lacustrine activity within the basin. Warm surface conditions and precipitation recharge of source basins is required to generate and sustain this long-lived lake over periods of at least centuries to millennia during the Late Hesperian to Early Amazonian. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

 abstract = {The geologic record of coastal California includes evidence of numerous volcanic centers younger than 30 Ma that do not appear to have erupted in an arc setting. By correlating these volcanic centers with specific slab windows predicted from analysis of magnetic anomalies on the Pacific plate, we add new constraints to tectonic reconstructions since 30 Ma. Our correlations, such as erupting the Morro Rock Islay Hill complex south of the Pioneer fracture zone and the Iversen Basalt south of the Mendocino fracture zone, require larger displacements within western North America than advocated by most previous authors. Specifically, we infer at least 315 km of motion between the Sierra Nevada and rigid North America at an azimuth of about N60 degrees W and at least 515 km between Baja California and rigid North America in a similar direction. A consequence of inferring a large displacement of Baja California is that the Pacific-North American plate boundary must have developed most of its current form prior to 10 Ma. We interpret a slab window developing between Cocos and Monterey plates after 19 Ma that reconstructs under nearly all of the southern California volcanic centers dated at 18-14 Ma. Most of the sedimentary basins associated with volcanic rocks show brief periods of rapid subsidence synchronous with volcanism, followed by slow subsidence of variable but often extended duration, consistent with rapid extension of cold lithosphere over recently introduced hot asthenosphere.},

 abstract = {Spinel harzburgite to lherzolite xenoliths are entrapped in Quaternary intraplate alkali basalts on Jeju Island, South Korea. These xenoliths are unusual in containing late-stage secondary orthopyroxene, free of deformation and exsolution that is replacing olivine as the main pervasive metasomatic mineral. These xenoliths are characterized by high Mg\# in olivine, orthopyroxene, and clinopyroxene (89–93) and variable Cr\# of spinel (9–53), representing residues left after variable degrees of melt extraction (̃25\%). In contrast to their depleted major-element compositions, clinopyroxenes in the xenoliths are enriched in most incompatible trace elements. Clinopyroxenes display enrichment in light rare earth elements (LREE) or spoon-shaped REE with a general enrichment in La over Ce, and depletion in high field strength elements (HFSE; e.g., Nb-Ta, Zr-Hf, Ti). Orthopyroxenes (either primary or secondary) are characterized by low TiO2, high Al2O3, and moderate CaO contents, and resemble those of sub-continental arc peridotites from the eastern Pacific. The geochemical evidence, in addition to the formation of secondary orthopyroxene, indicates that Jeju peridotite xenoliths have been subjected to different degrees of metasomatism by subduction-related silica- and LREE-enriched fluids (or melts). However, chemical equilibrium is evident between the primary and secondary orthopyroxene, implying that the duration of post-metasomatic high temperatures enabled complete resetting/reequilibration of the mineral compositions. The metasomatic enrichment pre-dates the host Jeju Quaternary magmatism, and a genetic relationship with the host magmas is considered unlikely. We therefore propose that the Jeju peridotite xenoliths went through a two-stage evolution, with their composition primarily controlled by early fractional melt extraction, which was subsequently modified by residual slab-derived fluids (or melts). Following enrichment in the peridotite protolith in the mantle wedge, the upper mantle beneath proto-Jeju Island was transformed from a subarc environment to an intraplate environment. The Jeju peridotites, representing old subarc fragments, were subsequently transported to the surface, incorporated into ascending Quaternary intraplate alkali basalt. The result of this study implies that long term material transfer in the transformation of geotectonic setting from a subarc to intraplate may have played a significant role in the evolution of the subcontinental lithospheric mantle, resulting in the enriched mantle domains, such as EMI or EMII.},

 abstract = {We use a 3D general circulation model to compare the primitive Martian hydrological cycle in "warm and wet" and "cold and icy" scenarios. In the warm and wet scenario, an anomalously high solar flux or intense greenhouse warming artificially added to the climate model are required to maintain warm conditions and an ice-free northern ocean. Precipitation shows strong surface variations, with high rates around Hellas basin and west of Tharsis but low rates around Margaritifer Sinus (where the observed valley network drainage density is nonetheless high). In the cold and icy scenario, snow migration is a function of both obliquity and surface pressure, and limited episodic melting is possible through combinations of seasonal, volcanic and impact forcing. At surface pressures above those required to avoid atmospheric collapse (̃0.5 bar) and moderate to high obliquity, snow is transported to the equatorial highland regions where the concentration of valley networks is highest. Snow accumulation in the Aeolis quadrangle is high, indicating an ice-free northern ocean is not required to supply water to Gale crater. At lower surface pressures and obliquities, both H2O and CO2 are trapped as ice at the poles and the equatorial regions become extremely dry. The valley network distribution is positively correlated with snow accumulation produced by the cold and icy simulation at 41.8 degrees obliquity but uncorrelated with precipitation produced by the warm and wet simulation. Because our simulations make specific predictions for precipitation patterns under different climate scenarios, they motivate future targeted geological studies.},

 abstract = {We derive an estimate for the chemical composition of the depleted MORB mantle (DMM), the source reservoir to mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORBs), which represents at least 30\% the mass of the whole silicate Earth. A database for the chemical and physical properties of abyssal peridotites has become robust and complete enough to truly access a reference DMM. Using trace element depletion trends from the abyssal peridotites, it is possible to construct a large part of DMM's trace element pattern. Splicing this information with isotopic constraints (Sr-Nd-Pb-Hf) and canonical ratios (Ce/Pb, Nb/Ta, Nb/U, Ba/Rb, H2O/Ce, CO2/Nb and Cl/K), we can extend abundance estimates to all the incompatible elements including volatile content. The resulting trace element pattern for average DMM constrains parental MORB to be generated by 6\% aggregated fractional melting, consistent with recent models for hydrous melting of the mantle [P.D. Asimow, J.E. Dixon, C.H. Langmuir, A hydrous melting and fractionation model for mid-ocean ridge basalts: application to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge near the Azores, Geochem. Geophys. Geosyst. 5 (2004) 10.1029/2003GC000568]. We show that DMM is roughly balanced by the continental crust and better balanced upon inclusion of ocean island basalt source and oceanic crust components. Compared to the primitive mantle, DMM has been depleted by 2-3\% melt extraction and has only 15\% the radiogenic heat production. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

 abstract = {We invert phase and amplitude data of Rayleigh waves for attenuation (Q−1) and shear wave velocities beneath southern California using teleseismic sources recorded by the TriNet/USArray network. Fundamental mode surface wave studies from 25 to 143 s period allow us to constrain the vertical variation of shear quality factor Qμ in the upper mantle. We use 2-D sensitivity kernels for surface waves based on single-scattering (Born) approximation to account for the effects of scattering on amplitude. A one-dimensional shear velocity model reveals a pronounced low velocity zone (LVZ) from ∼80 km to ∼200 km underlying a high velocity lid. Qμ shows a similar pattern; large Qμ at depths shallower than 80 km and much smaller Qμ at depths greater than 100 km. Models that attribute the variations of attenuation and shear velocities with depth solely to temperature and pressure effects predict too low Qμ values if they match the shear velocities. Alternative models considering the presence of partial melt can explain the observed very low Vs velocities in the asthenosphere. Partial melt in the asthenosphere could be generated due to decompression and the reduced solidus for damp mantle when the asthenosphere rose to fill the space left by the subducted Farallon plate.},

 abstract = {The sedimentary deposits of Meridiani Planum formed during the martian climate transition at the Noachian-Hesperian boundary between warm-wet and cold-dry conditions, and give valuable insight into how and when this transition occurred. We show that these deposits share characteristics with sedimentary outcrops across Arabia Terra. Despite near-ubiquitous dust cover across much of Arabia Terra, spectral signatures of polyhydrated sulfate minerals resembling those in Meridiani were identified in Schiaparelli and another unnamed crater. An erosional morphology analysis using both image and topographic data was then used to identify morphologies characteristic of Meridiani-type deposits and catalogue their occurrences throughout Arabia Terra. The occurrences of deposits with compositions and morphologies resembling the Meridiani deposits throughout Arabia Terra suggest that Meridiani-type sedimentary rocks were once more widespread. Elevations of the eroded remnants were used to reconstruct the pre-erosional paleo-surface of the deposits. Within this study area, these deposits once covered ̃2.5-3.6×10 6km 2 and represent an eroded volume of 0.9-1.7×10 6km 3 of sediment. Crater retention ages using craters of a range of preservation states and stratigraphic levels reveal that the deposits were laid down and subsequently eroded during a ̃270Myr period between ̃3.83 and 3.56Ga. The deposits formed following the transition from fluvial dissection to evaporite deposition at the end of the Noachian. The high erosion rates (̃3×10 -6m/yr) suggest that Mars may have maintained a thick atmosphere relative to today even as it dried out in the Early Hesperian. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

 abstract = {A new method based on quadratic constrained least- mean-square fitting to simultaneously determine both the best hy- perbolic and elliptical fits to a set of scattered data is presented. Thus a linear solution to the problem of hyperbola-specific fitting is revealed for the first time. Pilu's method to fit an ellipse (with respect to distance) to observed data points is extended to select, without prejudice, both ellipses and hyperbolæ as well as their degenerate forms as indicated by optimality with respect to the algebraic dis- tance. This novel method is numerically efficient and is suitable for fitting to dense datasets with low noise. Furthermore, it is deemed highly suited to initialize a better but more computationally costly least-square minimization of orthogonal distance. Moreover, Grass- mannian coordinates of the hyperbolæ are introduced, and it is shown how these apply to fitting a prototypical hyperbola. Two new theorems on fitting hyperbolæ are presented together with rigorous proofs. A new method to determine the spatial uncertainty of the fit from the eigen or singular values is derived and used as an indicator for the quality of fit. All proposed methods are verified using numeri- cal simulation, and working MATLAB ® programs for the implemen- tation are made available. Further, an application of the methods to automatic industrial inspection is presented.},

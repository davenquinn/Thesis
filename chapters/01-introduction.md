\chapter{Introduction}

Reading environmental markers from the geologic record is key to
understanding the evolution of the Earth through time. Packages of rock
provide a window into the systems and processes that operated throughout
the past. Their properties capture information about their formation
environment, and these vignettes can be used to test the applicability
of mechanistic and theoretical frameworks for global change.

Typically, geologic systems are understood by combining two distinct
scientific approaches.
First, key features are isolated
and probed with appropriate descriptive and analytical techniques,
developing a detailed understanding of individual components.
Second, these observations are contextualized with their surroundings,
integrating disparate environmental markers into a
sequence that can illuminate global change.
New areas of study opened by technological advances
often lack techniques to build context and bridge local and
global-scale insights. This thesis explores this gap in the
context of Mars science and the deep lithosphere of Earth.

# Observing geological systems at multiple scales

On Earth, operating over a range of scales has been fundamental
to geology since its inception as a branch of science. The earliest
scientific breakthroughs in geology were based on
based on microscopic features (the fossil content of rocks),
local relationships (outcrop geology and local structural
geometry), and regional correlations (structural mapping).
Global summary of regionally-observed trends has enabled
the systematization of Earth history and understanding of its
surface environment through time.

The methodology employed in targeted analytical studies has changed fundamentally over
time, with the development of imaging and geochemical techniques that
increase the amount and richness of information available from a single
sample. The techniques employed in global studies have dramatically
shifted as well, with satellite imaging and modeling approaches
fundamentally altering how problems are investigated, providing
powerful new types of information that are inseparable from their
technical underpinnings.

Technology has not had a similar effect on local and regional geology.
At the surface of the Earth, geological information is easily and
directly sensible by humans, and our understanding of regional-scale geologic
problems on Earth is limited primarily by the ability to
synthesize abundant data.
It is no surprise, then, that the tools to understand regional geologic
systems --- anchored by geologic mapping --- are still fundamentally the
same.

Rather than replacing the technique of regional mapping,
technology-driven progress in adjacent fields has encouraged
re-interpretation based on new theoretical frameworks [e.g @Atwater1970;
@Liu2010].
A key case is the recent debate over the age of the Grand Canyon:
geochemical ages constraining canyon incision
must be reconciled with geologic cross-cutting relationships to
understand their true meaning [e.g. @Wernicke2011;
@Flowers2012; @Lucchitta2013]. The scale mismatch between localized
geochemical data and regional geologic systems means that
detailed regional mapping retains its importance to contextualize new
analytical findings.

Technological advances in the geosciences have opened once-inaccessible systems to
investigation. However, new techniques often find it hard to replicate
the intermediate-scale context offered by geologic mapping.
In geochemistry, for instance, global averaging provides powerful proxies
for understanding the evolution of the Earth, its
composition, and its surface biogeochemical systems [e.g. @DePaolo1976b;
@Paytan2004; @Rohrbach2007; @Workman2005; @Halverson2010], and
small-scale geochemical systems have become increasingly well understood [e.g. @Gansecki1998;
@Bindeman2008], However, regional contextualization of geochemical results is still
dependent on mapping studies: examples include the basin-scale
stratigraphy of the Nama Group required to contextualize
Cambrian-boundary isotopic shifts in seawater composition [e.g. @Saylor1995;
@Dibenedetto2005] and the identification of a "Sr-0.706" line on the
west coast of North America and its interpretation of the boundary
signature of the cratonic core [e.g. @Kistler1973; @Farmer1983].
Where the target is not accessible at the Earth's
surface, such as in studies of deep continental structure,
relationships must be inferred from relatively limited sample
sets [e.g. @Luffi2009].

A similar lack of regional context afflicts Mars science.
At global scale, generalized study of the
planet's surface is enabled by remote-sensing data [e.g. @Malin2000; @Murchie2007; @McEwen2010],
and modeling can drive understanding of the global environment through time
[e.g. @Wordsworth2015; @Soucek2015]. Meanwhile,
localized systems can be studied using rovers [e.g. @Squyres2005; @Grotzinger2012]
or Mars meteorites, as
permitted by sampling [e.g. @Rankenburg2006; @Agee2014]. Cases where
abundant data is available, such as landed rover campaigns, have made
the most progress in understanding the evolution of integrated geologic
systems [e.g. @Grotzinger2005Burns; @Arvidson2014; @Grotzinger2015].
However there remains a major lack of both spatial and temporal context
for localized observations.
Rover-scale observations cover tiny areas of the planet and sometimes
difficult to generalize with orbital observations [@Stack2015].
Further, inferring planetary evolution from
rover campaigns is difficult due to the lack of time constraints
on geologic snapshots characterized during landed missions.
Attempts to bridge this conceptual divide
necessarily involve modeling [@Tosca2006; @Andrews-Hanna2007]
or detailed geologic mapping [@Lichtenberg2010].
However, both of these approaches must be undertaken with much sparser datasets
than are available on Earth.

# Continental margins as archives of past environment

This thesis consists of several projects that explore different
parts of this conceptual space and try to bridge the scale gap
through the application of new methodologies. Within this overarching framework,
the investigations here are aligned by their examination of the
structure of continental margins.
On both Earth and Mars, continental edges are
expressed as regions of high topographic gradients separating areas of
fundamentally different crustal composition and structure.
The topographic gradients of continental margins on both Earth and Mars
provide a setting for the formation and preservation of stratigraphies that
record the surface environment at key time periods in planetary evolution.

On Earth, continents are formed by tectonic processes, and continental
edges are the locus of this construction. Chapter 2 of this thesis
describes the process of construction of the continental margin
terrane of coastal central California.
This study uses investigation of mantle-sourced xenolith samples
to estimate the structure
and origin of a mantle domain beneath the Coast Ranges, linking
the two scales using both a review of geologic context and heat-flow modeling.

The latest Neoproterozoic Eon and its boundary with the Cambrian Period is
a time of rapid global change culminating in origin of animal life
[@Hoffman1998; @Knoll1999]. Stratigraphies covering this period can yield
information on the regional environment during this period of global change. In
Chapter 3, we apply structural mapping techniques to the Naukluft Nappe Complex
in Namibia, which dates from this time period but is tectonically displaced and
deformed. We present the first detailed description of a thick, continuous
passive-margin stratigraphy that records the Neoproterozoic paleoenvironment at
the margin of the Kalahari Craton. This study is a straightforward application
of geologic mapping and stratigraphy, eased by the introduction of new
technology into the mapping process.

The remainder of this thesis deals with the structural assessment of
paleoenvironmentally important stratigraphies on Mars. Reconstruction of
depositional environments from Martian sedimentary rocks is limited by the
accuracy of bedding orientation measurements. Chapter 4 explores the difficulty
of making structural measurements from orbital data, and proposes general
statistical and visualization tools to improve error reporting and data quality
for remotely-sensed bedding orientations. Chapter 5 applies this method, along
with regional mapping, to northeast Syrtis Major, a stratigraphy dating from
early in Mars' history, in order to infer the surface environmental progression
within the region. We find evidence for episodes of regional inundation and
erosion spanning much of Mars history, from the Noachian to Early Amazonian.
